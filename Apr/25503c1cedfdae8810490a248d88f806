The second phase will cost US $20m and an additional US $15m will be used in the construction of infrastructure in the cities of Nairobi, Nakuru, Kisumu and parts of the western region. “When you calculate the sum of the down-stream infrastructure in Kisumu, Rift Valley, Nairobi and Western funds plus the funds that will be used here in Mombasa, the total foreign direct investment will add up to US $75m,” Mwaniki said. In addition, the Manager Beckett mentioned that from the Comarco’s private port, the mounded LPG terminal will be fed by a newly established floating storage vessel with a capacity to hold between 5, 000 and 10,000 tonnes. Upon completion, the facility will move approximately 12,500 tonnes per month. This move is anticipated to bring changes to the Liquefied Petroleum Gas supply in Kenya which has been dominated by African Gas and Oil Ltd who has been importing the gas into the country.
