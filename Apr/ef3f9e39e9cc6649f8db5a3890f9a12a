The government of Tanzania has announced its intentions to construct a world class cruise ship terminal on its Dar es salaam port in an effort to improve transport from abroad through the Indian ocean to the country. Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Nature Resources and Tourism, Dr Aloyce Nzuki revealed the reports and said construction of the special terminal would be done during the on-going expansion of the port and new facility would enable handling of tourists without disrupting activities of handling other cargo ships at the port. “Cruise ship tourism is common and popular. Currently the country is not benefiting a lot from the Cruise Ship tourism because the terminal has not been constructed. This limits the number of cruise liners docking at the port,” said Dr Nzuki.
