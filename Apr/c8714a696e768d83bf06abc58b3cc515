The water supply project, scheduled to go online in the fall of 2019, features the construction of a new 305-acre reservoir fed by a 3.7-mile long, 48-inch steel pipeline that draws water from the Etowah River to the north. The new water treatment plant will draw raw water from the new reservoir and produce drinking water for 47,000 customers at a rate of 18 million gallons per day (mgd), expandable to 36 mgd. Critical elements in the water supply program included the 2,965-foot long earthen dam, a concrete river intake and pump station, raw water pipeline to the reservoir, drinking water distribution system improvements, and water treatment plant (WTP) with reservoir intake and pumping station. Burlington, Vermont-based PC Construction, one of the key players in the $215 million Richland Creek Reservoir Water Supply Program, built the water treatment plant as well as other elements of the project. Because Xypex Admix C-500 crystalline waterproofing was used in all of the water-holding structures in the WTP, PC Construction was able to achieve leak-free concrete without any additional.
