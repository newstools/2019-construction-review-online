Liberia has announced to have commenced pavement works on the Ganta – Yekepa highway which the government earmarked more than 10 years ago. The construction of the stretch of road was earmarked in 2007 as a birthday gift to former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf when Lakshmi Mittal, Chief Executive Officers (CEO) of ArcerlorMittal (AML), visited Liberia. However, the entire exercise later came to a standstill due to government’s inability to fund the project. In June, 2018, President George Weah pressed AML management to release US $40m money intended for the project in order to fast track the project. Upon President Weah’s visit to Nimba, the road work resumed but continued at a slow pace until recently when the company began speeding up the work leading to the pavement of a considerable stretch of road.

The Company also won the tender to supply the country with all the necessary equipment for the project. It is projected that CSE may likely complete the pavement of half of the road stretch between Ganta and Sanniquellie, before the dry season and will be expected to generate some 2,000 short- to medium- term jobs.
