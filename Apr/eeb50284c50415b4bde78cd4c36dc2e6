The disputes which was between EEP and two contractors, Cambridge Industries and its partner, China National Electric Engineering Company (CNEE) led to the plant ceasing operations after its inauguration. Cambridge Industries argues that the facility had a planned shutdown to complete handover discussions to an operation team from the Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) team. Moges Mekonnen, corporate communications director of EEP has however affirmed that the issues have been resolved. Moses also explained that despite the resumption of the facility settled, the two parties are still at loggerheads regarding power generating capacity.
