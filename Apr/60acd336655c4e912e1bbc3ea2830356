The study noted that the Deep Sea Slum residents have set up illegitimate structures and they have declined an order to move from the government land. Amnesty International have been defending the people, a possible reason why they are been stubborn. Eng. Emil Flkiu, Reynolds Construction Company (RCC) however affirmed that the issues have been sorted and are already working on the interchange along the Likoni and Enterprise junction all the way to Jogoo road. He further made a promise to the Nairobi County Development Implementation Coordination Committee members (CDICC) to complete the projects as scheduled. Additionally, Eng. David Mutuohoro from KURA said the cooperation had compensated affected people in the area.
