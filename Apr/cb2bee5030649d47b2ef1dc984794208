The Arab Republic of Egypt through the states Ministry of Housing, has begun working on a programme that will lead to the construction of more than 1.1 million residential units over the next five years; in an effort to cater for the simultaneously growing population and demand for affordable housing in the country. With its population growing at a rate of roughly 2% a year, Egypt currently has a population of 100,816,867 people and 38.7% of them (39,172,736 people) are in the urban centers causing an urbanization crisis in the country due to lack of low-income and social housing availability across the nation. Speaking at the LafargeHolcim Forum for Sustainable Construction, a recent forum hosted by LafargeHolcim Group at the American University in Cairo (AUC), the deputy Minister of Housing Mr. Khaled Abbas said that establishment of new urban communities is one of the key drivers to economic growth in Egypt, and building sustainably is a main concern in the country’s Vision for 2030.
