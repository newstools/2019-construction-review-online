Additionally the project’s objective is to facilitate investments in renewable energy that will reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in South Africa, as well as contribute to the power generation mix in line with South African government’s Integrated Resource Plan that seeks to immensely reduce greenhouse-gas emissions as indicated in the National Development Plan 2030. The project is scheduled to have compelling developmental impacts through the sub projects indicated. The benefits of the project include social benefits like reduced Carbon Dioxide emissions, increased efficiency in the energy sector all over the country and also increased generation capacity of renewable energy sources. The country will also benefit economically by opening up more job opportunities in the energy sector across the sub projects of gas, wind and biomass. In addition the project is expected to contribute in unlocking private sector investments and increase the availability of long term funds to aid projects in the energy sector all over the country.
