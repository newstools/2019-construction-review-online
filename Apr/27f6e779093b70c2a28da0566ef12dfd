The government of South Sudan has signed an agreement with Chinese firm, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) to develop 26 hospitals across the nation. Riek Gai Kok, Minister of Health confirmed the reports and said that the hospitals projects are in line with presidential pledge made in 2010 by President Salva Kiir to boost access to health care in the East African state. “CCEC has offered to effectively execute some projects in South Sudan. Our chief focus right now is the implementation of the pledge made by President Salva Kiir in 2010,” said Riek Gai.

Modernization and expansion of health facilities in South Sudan South Sudan is already benefiting from a grant of about US $33m provided by the Chinese government in 2013 to update and expand health facilities in the nation that has massively improved health care across South Sudan. One of the main developments is the main referral hospital, the Juba Teaching Hospital which is currently undergoing modernization and expansion work. South Sudan is reeling from the past war and a dysfunctional political system which has made it hard for the country to develop its infrastructure. Earlier this year, India pledged to building the country’s first mental health centre, but construction on the project has yet to begin. The Indian embassy is not commenting on an expected date of completion.
