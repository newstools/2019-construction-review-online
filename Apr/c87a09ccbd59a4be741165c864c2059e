Uganda is set to open the US $5m  Kasese one stop border post in Kasese District. President Yoweri Museveni will perform the commissioning ceremony. The project which began in 2018 is part of the Great Lakes Trade Facilitation (GLTF) project which seeks to boost trade between Uganda and DR Congo. It was implemented by the government through the Ministries of Trade, Industry, Cooperatives, Works and Transport and launched by Works and transport minister, Engineer Monica Azuba and of State for Trade, Mr Michael Werikhe in September 2017.

The new facility features security agencies offices, immigration offices, Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) among others. According to Ministry of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives in the COMESA region DRC is Uganda’s second largest market after South Sudan, with Kenya coming third in the grid, therefore Uganda’s move to construct the border post comes as a huge boost. It is expected to speed up service delivery at the Uganda-DRC border therefore enhancing business. “This project is aimed at facilitating cross-border trade by increasing the capacity of commerce and reducing costs incurred by traders on both sides,” said Ms Monica Azuba.  Regional leaders agreed to construct border points across the countries to  fight insecurity and reduce poverty while promoting shared prosperity among the vulnerable groups at the border areas. The projects will also see promotion of cross-border trade, ensuring food security and economic interdependence. Similar border posts in Busia had earlier last year been commissioned by Museveni and Kenya’s President Uhuru other centers constructed in Bunagana and Gole in Kabale and Arua districts respectively.
