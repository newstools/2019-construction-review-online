Governor Stephen Sang’s administration took over the construction of the Sports Complex in September last year. The structure would be initially named Kipchoge Keino Stadium but the governor upon the takeover announced that the facility would be renamed to commemorate the newly renowned athlete. The entire sports complex, upon completion in October this year shall boast a 200 bed capacity for boarding athletes, swimming pool, an art studio, and gallery that will be named after prominent heroes and heroines in the sports sector. Last year Governor Sang noted that his government will work with schools to nurture talents and use the new sport complex grounds for trials for the next world championship as well as the summer Olympics. Mr. Sang lately has also revealed a grand plan to give the county’s sports sector a new face by constructing new world-class training grounds and revamping the existing grounds. He also revealed plans to sell the county to international sports brands with help from renowned athletic champions like Eliud Kipchoge, Amos Kipruto among other athletes from the county.
