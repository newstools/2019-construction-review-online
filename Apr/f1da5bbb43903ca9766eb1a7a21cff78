The road provides alternative access route to Kasungu district and beyond to those from Central and Southern part of Malawi by connecting with the M18. It further provides an alternative route into the Northern corridor via the Lilongwe West Bypass thereby decongesting the M1 road that runs from Lilongwe to Kasungu. National Roads Authority (NRA) Chief Executive Officer, Emmanuel Matapa said the project will deliberately include the overhead bridge following construction recommendations to reduce accidents between locomotives and vehicles. The Chief Secretary said the project connects areas that are high in agricultural activities which will give easy mobility of people and goods. “The road gives easy access to markets for agricultural produce.By providing easy mobility and accessibility the road will also enhance economic activities to the areas around and beyond,” said Lloyd Muhara.
