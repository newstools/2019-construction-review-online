The government of Tunisia has unveiled contractors for six 10 MW solar projects in the country’s second solar tender that was launched in August last year. The country’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Renewable Energies announced the reports and said the project contracts were awarded to Abo Wind AG and Bejulo GmbH of Germany, Spanish multinational EPC provider Enerland, France-based VSB Energies Nouvelles, China’s ET Solar, and a consortium formed by Aurora, Suneq and Suntrace.

The first tender which was finalized last year awarded six 10 MW solar parks and four 1 MW ground-mounted installations. The remaining 6 MW was not allocated for development. Besides countries like Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, Tunisia now stands out as one of the most electrified countries in Africa. According to a report released by the “African Business,” Tunisia currently ranks first with over 95% electrification rate. Gas power generation dominates the country’s energy mix accounting for over 90% of the total power generation. The current government is however working to reduce the dependency on gas energy by appreciating and developing renewable energy source such a solar. Under its renewable energy strategy, Tunisia aims to deploy around 4.7 GW of clean energy capacity by 2030. The aim to achieve the 4.7 GW clean energy target has led the country to tender another 500 MW of solar, which is widely expected to choose larger projects. So far, it has released a list of 16 pre-qualified developers. The round will facilitate the construction of a 200 MW solar plant in Tatouine, in the Sahara Desert; two 100 MW PV facilities in Kaiouran and Gafsca; and two 50 MW solar parks in Sidi Bouzid and Tozeur.
