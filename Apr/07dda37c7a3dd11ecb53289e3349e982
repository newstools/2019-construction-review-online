Feasibility study for the Flying Academy undertaken by Southwest Jiaotong University commenced last year and it is expected to end soon while the actual work for the entire project is set to begin in June this year with civil works kicking off first. Prof Zacharia Mganilwa, the head of NIT said that this development is very crucial to Tanzanians because the country needs more pilots, aircraft maintenance engineers and cabin crews all of whom will be trained at the NUT’s school of Aero scope science & technology and the Flying Academy upon completion. On the NIT’s expansion pipeline, there is also construction of the institutions’ College of Marine campus in Lindi where it has acquired a 150 acre parcel of land but a source for the funds is yet to be found.
