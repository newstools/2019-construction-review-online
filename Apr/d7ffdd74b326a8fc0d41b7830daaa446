The project aims to enhance the value of natural resources, substantially increase the production capacity of the interconnected network, reduce the average cost of energy production for the distributor and improve the quality of the public electricity service, according to the government.

PowerPro was chosen to install this photovoltaic solar power plant in a BOOT (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer). The capacity installed at the end of phase one will be 29.6 MW. According to the PPA agreement, upon completion of the plant state run power utility company, Energie du Mali (EDM) will purchase energy from PowerPro for 28 years For the majority in Mali the main energy source is open fires, which puts pressure on the country’s forests. Executing efficient energy schemes in rural areas of Malawi will play a major role in alleviating poverty and reducing inequalities in some of the country’s most vulnerable communities. The Government of Mali is multiplying initiatives to promote this energy source.The initiative will focus more on the development of renewable energy projects, including solar energy. The World Bank funding is part of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Regional Electricity Access Project.
