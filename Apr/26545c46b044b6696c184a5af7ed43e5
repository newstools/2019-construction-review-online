David Morley explained that their association with Sharpooji was aimed at fast-tracking delivery of homes at scale that reflects the needs of buyers. “There is a huge demand for affordable and middle-income homes and the goal of the joint-venture platform will be to bridge the gap in this market. There is a notable lack of institutional quality home builders with the expertise, capital and consumer trust to truly address the opportunity at scale in Kenya,” said Mr David. “Actis and Shapoorji Pallonji in India have delivered thousands of high quality, aspirational homes at affordable prices. We are confident that Actis investment experience in Africa coupled with Shapoorji Pallonji’s experience in construction and real estate development will unlock the significant opportunity,” David added.
