Kenya is set to sign the US $3bn deal with USA for the construction of Nairobi-Mombasa expressway this month. US Ambassador to Kenya Kyle McCarter announced the reports and said the deal will pave way for construction works to begin anytime after June. The contract includes development of three additional Special Economic Zones along the alignment next to strategic interchanges which will bring additional revenue to the national and county governments. Bechtel, a US-based private construction conglomerate, won the contract in a government-to-government deal that formed part of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s discussions with President Donald Trump during his US visit last year.
