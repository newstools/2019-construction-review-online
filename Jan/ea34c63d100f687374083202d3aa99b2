The Government of Uganda represented by the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) is seeking to partner with a private sector to design, build, operate, maintain and transfer a limited access tolled expressway between the cities of Kampala and Jinja in Uganda. The process of choosing a fit company is underway with the government having four bids to choose from. The companies that have already submitted their bids include Strabag of Germany, China’s Communications Construction Company among others. The Ugandan government and the contractor will each contribute US $400m and US $600m respectively and an additional US $500m will be needed to fund acquisition of land, debt financing and operating costs. This project will be the first built in the country using a public-private partnership (PPP) model. This implies that the contractor awarded the contract will design, build and operate the route for 30 years, earning profits by charging tolls before transferring the ownership to the state.
