Phase 1 scope of the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) of the Nigeria Morocco Gas Pipeline (NMGP) is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019. This is according to Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Dr. Ibe Kachikwu. Speaking during the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS) holding in Abuja, the Minister said that the NMGP designed to be 5,660km long, will reduce gas flaring in Nigeria and encourage diversification of energy resources in the country. “This pipeline will help in the industrialization of these countries. It will also meet the needs of consumers for heating and other uses. We see gas as a fuel to take Africa to the next level. New gas discoveries have been recorded offshore Senegal, Mauritania, Mozambique and are in various stages of development,” said Dr. Ibe Kachikwu.

FEED is the basic engineering which comes after the conceptual design or feasibility study. The feasibility study of the gas pipeline that will traverse at least 15 West African countries and connect the existing Europe gas pipeline has been concluded and the pre-FID (final investment decision) greenfield optimization study is currently ongoing. Additionally, the African Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) is seeking to mobilize about US $2bn of resources to fund critical areas of infrastructural collaboration within Africa. APPO made up of 18 member oil producing countries, accounts for nearly 95% of Africa’s oil production and  at least 13% of world production.
