The Government of Ghana is set to revamp the Tema Motorway connecting Tema to Accra into a six lane at a cost of US $56m with the aim of easing traffic on the Eastern Corridor and neighboring countries including Togo. The Minister of Roads and Highways, Mr. Kwasi Amoako Atta, confirmed the reports and said that the government is currently focused on tackling obstacles such as the massive encroachment on the reserved zone for the project, which was build under the Administration of Dr Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first President.

It is funded by the Japanese government through the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) and stretches from Lagos through Lomé, Accra, and Abidjan to Dakar and effectively serving as the junction to the Sub-region. Phase one of the project begun on February 2018 and is expected to be complete by 28 months. Under it, a three dual carriage with 730m underpass on the National route would be constructed that will be 2.1km long. Phase two will entail construction of a flyover on the Akosombo-Tema Harbour Road. The project will also conduct detailed design improvements for the rehabilitation of National Trunk Road N8 in the Central Region. The Minister also cautioned property development agencies and individuals to desist from building on and close to road reserve zones and that authorities would get tough by demolishing structures located within such exclusive zones.
