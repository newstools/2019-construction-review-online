South Africa’s city of Johannesburg has launched a programme to rejuvenate the inner-city with a tour of the first three of 84 buildings targeted for development. Mayor Herman Mashaba confirmed the reports and said the project is aimed at offering quality low-cost accommodation for residents to solve the problem of a housing backlog which has raised up to over 300 000 units. “It is estimated that the city of Johannesburg’s inward migration is set at about 3 000 people per month, which undoubtedly adds greater pressure on us to deliver services efficiently,” said Mayor Herman.
