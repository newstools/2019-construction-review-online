Works that Kenya’s Shiv Construction Company is handling are at foundation level. The sports CS however clarified and said that the government is continuing to source for more funds to speed up the completion. “The north Rift region is known of athletics and other sports and we would like to see more events held here as part of encouraging youths to participate in various disciplines. We have greed with the contractors to speed up the stadium works so that it can be ready for use as we continue sourcing for more funds,” said Echesa. WIETEC Company had been initially awarded the tender to construct the VIP pavilion, terraces, changing rooms and parking lot. But terms changed when Kenya was stripped of hosting rights of the Africa Nations Championships football tournament some of whose matches were to be held at the stadium. Additionally, Mr. Rashid Echesa said the county government has 26 acres of land they wish to negotiate with the Kenya Forest Service and Kenya Prisons Service to help secure and extend for the construction of another stadium.
