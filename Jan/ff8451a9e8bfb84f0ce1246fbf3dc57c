The concrete batching plant is mainly composed of a mixing host, an aggregate bin, cement silo, and a screw conveyor. Compared with the large concrete plant, small concrete plant usually has smaller productivity. It can be equipped with a full automatic weighing system to promote the accuracy weight of aggregate, powder, and liquid through electronic scales and microcomputers. Due to its low investment, wide application, flexibility, and convenience, we have to say it is the best choice for small and medium-sized projects.  Camelway has been a reputable manufacturer of stationary, mobile, and compact concrete plants. There’re three models of Camelway low capacity concrete batching plant: HZS25 concrete batching plant (25m³/h), HZS35 concrete batching plant (35m³/h), HZS50 concrete batching plant（50m³/h). Small concrete batching plant  It mainly consists of cement silo, PLD batching machine, twin shaft concrete mixer, PC control system and weighing system. The small concrete batching plant has features such as low investment and high return due to its relatively small scale. Small concrete batching plant applies in all kinds of small and medium-sized concrete prefabricated components factories and the investment projects of the small commercial concrete plant.
