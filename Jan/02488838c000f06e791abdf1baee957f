The energy that will produced is expected to be sold to Kaduna Power Supply Company, the local company responsible for electricity distribution. This new contract is in addition to the South African company’s portfolio, which invests heavily in the African continent. In Nigeria, it is preparing to supply a total of 300 MW in several states. “This transaction is an example of an African solution to African problems and, more importantly, it offers a real opportunity for collaboration between South Africa and Nigeria,” Linda Mabhena-Olagunju, added.
