So far, two companies have signed to install 11 turbine generators, each generating 400 megawatts of electricity. The electro-mechanical work in question was supposed to be done by Metal and Engineering Corporation (MetEC), the military-affiliated engineering complex. However, the Ethiopian government cancelled the contract with MetEC because the latter failed to make much progress, creating substantial delays of the project.
