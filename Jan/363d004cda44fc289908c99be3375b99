The government of Zambia has allocated US $20m to construct a new State House based on 2017 recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on Works and Supply. Housing and Infrastructure Development Minister Ronald Chitotela confirmed the reports and said the Parliament Committe saw an urgent need for the government to commence modalities to construct a new state house in view of security concerns. Minister Ronald Chitotela pointed out that the current state house building had developed cracks and was, therefore deemed dangerous to the President and State House members of staff.

Meanwhile the government is currently constructing a new Government House (Official residence for the vice president) in Lusaka. Construction started early last year but has however been kept secret after the 2017 proposal to construct a new State House was widely condemned as a bad priority.
