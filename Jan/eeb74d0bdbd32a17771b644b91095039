The AfDB will provide a loan worth US$8.3m while the Chinese fund, Africa Growing Together Funds (AGTF) will provide US$5.5m. The funding will help finance a programme to ensure the sustainability and security of access to water in the country. The works concern the supply of raw water from the “Ghriss” dam to the Al Hoceima treatment plant and the supply of water from the Ibn Battouta dam to the Mharhar treatment plant (Tangier). The programme will also strengthen the water treatment capacity of the Beni Mellal region, the production of water in the Zagora region from the “Agdez” dam, and the production of water in the Guercif region (from the “Targa or Madi” dam). A credit agreement worth US $5.2m was also signed by Morocco and the French Development Agency (AFD), last year which was granted to ONEE so as to improve and expand the quality of drinking water service in the north of Morocco. The project will help benefit nearly 300, 000 Moroccans. Morocco also took another loan with the German Public Development Bank (KfW) worth US $70m which is expected to help finance three drinking water supply projects in the country.
