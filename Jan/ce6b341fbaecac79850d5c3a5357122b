Takeuchi has released what it calls “a true 5-ton excavator,” the 10,957-pound TB250-2 designed for landscaping, general contracting and rental. TB250-2 features a long arm with an integrated thumb mount and has a max dig depth of 12 feet 4.8 inches. It has a standard Fleet Management telematic system which offers information on location, utilization, performance and maintenance, helping ensure machine up time and availability. A four-pump hydraulic system gives the unit multi-function capability; precision pilot joysticks deliver smooth, metered control. A primary auxiliary hydraulic circuit, controlled using a proportional slide switch located on the left hand joystick, delivers 24.2 gpm. Operators can adjust hydraulic flow rates from the cab, and multiple presets allow attachments to be quickly exchanged. A detent mode provides continuous oil flow for various hydraulic attachments. The cab features a high capacity HVAC system, and rocker control switches to control a wide range of functions. A large easy-to-read monitor offers information on machine health and performance. The high back suspension seat can be adjusted for height, weight, fore and aft positions and tilt. Large hoods on the side and back of the machine open overhead, providing access to daily inspection points, the control pattern change valve, selector valve, control valve, battery and toolbox. All grease points are clearly marked and easy to locate down one side of the machine. Fuel fill is located behind a lockable access panel; a site gauge simplifies refueling.
