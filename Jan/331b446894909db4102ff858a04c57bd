The machine is also equipped with a standard universal coupler. An electrically activated coupler is an available option, allowing operators to switch attachments from the cab. The 903D also features Z-bar loader linkage which Cat says provides “both aggressive bucket-digging ability and efficient control in fork applications.” Boom-float and return-to-dig functions are standard features. Inside the cab, operators will find a new multi-function joystick which provides controls for directional changes, third-function hydraulics, the diff locks and continuous hydraulic flow. The new cab also has more leg room, improved pedal positioning, and improved entry/exit over the 903C2, Cat says, along with a suspension seat and tilt steering wheel.
