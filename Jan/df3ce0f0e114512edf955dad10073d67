AEES1’s project was financed by loans from IFC, lead arranger, Asian Infrastructure Investment bank (AIIB), African Development Bank Group and CDC Group and equity from Alcazar Energy. The project was constructed by a joint venture between TSK and Enviromena. All four of the Benban solar PV projects are expected to generate approximately  US $31.5 million in gas savings from the displacement of fossil fuels, in addition to saving 311,500 tones of carbon dioxide and 680,300 cubic metre of water per year. When complete, Benban solar park itself will illuminate thousands of homes, industries and commercial premises. That will help provide Egypt, a fast-growing country of more than 100 million residents, with the clean energy it needs to drive growth. At the same time, the park will also help in reducing global greenhouse gas emission.
