The whole batching plant includes the following modules: host, metering, batching machine and control room. And each module has been finished in the factory, simple installation is the thing that you need to do in the spot. i) High efficiency: the actual productivity is relatively high.
ii) Energy saving: compared with traditional concrete plant, the containerized concrete batch plant consumes less power. Besides, it can support energy-saving measures and reduce motor power. i) Small footprint and high land utilization rate;
ii) Modular design, convenient installation and convenient transportation;
iii) Low maintenance costs. containerized concrete batch plant is a high-integration of modern mixing technology, environmental protection technology, information intelligent technology and urban art. At the same time, it is embodied in the aspects of environmental protection, low-carbon energy-saving, high-efficiency energy-saving, and intelligent information in the operation of the equipment. The various emissions (gas, liquid, solid) and noise in the production process meet the prescribed standards. The containerized concrete batch plant, all in all, is a new type of commercial concrete mixing equipment launched by Camelway on the basis of absorbing the high-tech of concrete mixing equipment at home and abroad. This batch plant integrates Camelwayâ€™s own manufacturing experience and user feedback. And it keeps continuously innovating, improving and perfecting. The container-type concrete mixing plant not only solves the pollution problem, but also improves the material utilization rate, which is a win-win situation for both ecological and economic benefits. In addition, it is a fully enclosed green environmental concrete batching station.
