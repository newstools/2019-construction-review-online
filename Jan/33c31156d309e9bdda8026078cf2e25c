As a multi award winning bathroom and kitchen manufacturer, KOHLER takes the design and performance of their sanitary ware seriously and that doesn’t stop at their toilet seats. This premium brand is pleased to announce the arrival of their sleek new Slim Seats for the Reve, Replay and Modern Life ranges, with Escale and Presqu’ile to follow suit. As the name suggests, Slim Seats are soft close toilet seats that embrace contemporary
aesthetics. Their considerably thinner profile makes them stylish and elegant and ensures that they don’t interfere with the clean-lined look of KOHLER’S toilet bowls. Beyond their good looks, the new Slim Seats are made from urea-formaldehyde, which renders them stronger and more durable than ever before. In addition to this, KOHLER is launching GermShield for their Modern Life range of
contemporary toilets and basins. As it is, the Modern Life collection aims to offer superior
hygiene and ease of cleaning via purpose designed elements such as the easy lift toilet seat. Taking hygiene to new heights, GermShield is a superior technology anti-microbial glaze, which prevents the growth of bacteria, viruses, mould, fungi and other microorganisms from growing and spreading, making bathroom hygiene the least of your concerns.
