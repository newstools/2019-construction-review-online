The concrete batching plant usually divides into sand and gravel feeding, powder feeding, water and admixture feeding, conveying mixing and storage. Besides, this hzs 35 concrete plant is casted by steel structure. At the same time, the high-quality H-shaped steel not only has beautiful appearance, but strengthens the overall structural strength of the concrete plant. Moreover, this equipment is easy to install and can be applied to various complicated terrain. The followings are some main features of hzs 35 concrete batching plant. i) The mixing machine adopts two JS750 twin-shaft forced mixers with good mixing quality and high efficiency.
ii) The ingredients of aggregate, cement, water and liquid admixture are all measured by electronic scale. At the same time, it has a high batching precision.
iii) The electrical control system adopts imported components, with complete functions, reliable performance and convenient operation.  The Camelwayhzs 35 concrete batching plantÂ has good mixing performance. As we mentioned before, it adopts JS750 spiral twin-shaft forced mixing machine. So this mixer usually uses to mix dry hard, plastic and various proportions of concrete, achieving a good mixing effect. Besides, the cement stores in cement silo, conveying by screw conveyor and weighing by cement scale. All in all, this hzs 35 concrete plant is a good choice for small and medium-sized construction projects, prefabricated factories and commercial concrete production plants.
