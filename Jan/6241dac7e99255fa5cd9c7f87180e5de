The Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) has signed a US $250m contract with Japanese-based Sumitomo Mitsui Construction Company (SMCC) to construct a four way bridge along Bandari Road of Gerezani in Dar es Salaam City. Speaking during the signing ceremony, Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads) Chief Executive Office Mr. Patrick Mfungale said that the deal will be funded as grant by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). “US $222m will be spent on the contractor while US $28m will be spent on Ingerosec Corporation of Japan, the consultancy company for the project. However we will have to source funds from the third phase of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) to complete the bridge since the current funds will not be sufficient,” said Mr. Isack Kamwelwe.
