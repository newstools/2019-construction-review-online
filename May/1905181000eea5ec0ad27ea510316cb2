Eudes Kayumba, Deputy Team Leader of the Green City Pilot project confirmed the reports and said they are finalizing on relevant studies and designs to pave way for construction to begin. Mr. Kayumba noted that the project aims to showcase the viability of green cities in Rwanda and elements that could be replicated in the development of secondary cities across the country with green technologies and innovations for green and climate resilient urbanization.

It is estimated to cost a whopping US $5bn and the funding will come from different stakeholders who have committed to pool resources to ensure the completion of the project. The city will feature clean technologies, electric vehicles, electric bicycle and motorcycle lanes, renewable energy, sustainable waste treatment, biogas plants, urban forests, among others. Construction will mainly use local building materials which will make houses more affordable and environmentally sustainable. “The estate will also have mini-factories with clean technologies, affordable housing, integrated craft production centres. We are conducting a study to estimate the jobs that will be created based on how the residents of the area generate income,” said Mr. Kayumba. Currently, Rwanda Green Fund (Fonerwa), with the financial support of the German Development Cooperation – through the KfW Development Bank – is undertaking a feasibility study for the Green Pilot, and contracted Sweco, a European engineering and architecture firm, to support the implementation of the project.
