The African Development Bank (AfDB) has agreed to loan the Tanzanian government over US $18m for the construction of 110.2km Dodoma city outer ring-road, rehabilitation and/or replacement of existing drainage structures and the construction of new additional drainage structures. This is according to the president of Tanzania H.E John Magufuli when he was speaking in Mbeya during the celebrations of international workers day. The proposed road shall run from the Dodoma – Kondoa trunk road at a settlement known as Veyula and crisscross southeast towards another settlement called Ihumwa along Dodoma – Morogoro trunk road. On or after Ihumwa the road shall snake southwards to the Matumbulu settlement along Dodoma – Iringa trunk road then proceed northwest to Nala settlement situated alongside Dodoma – Singida trunk road before the loop ends at Veyula settlement. The project will be implemented by the Tanzania Roads Agency (TANROADS), an Executive Agency under the Ministry of Works, Transport, and Communication which was established under the Executive Agencies Act in 2000 and given the mandate to maintain and develop trunk and regional road networks in Tanzania Mainland.

In addition heavy vehicles moving through the City from the four main trunk roads will be sidetracked into the oncoming ring road to either bypass Dodoma city totally or to move to a different route that will eventually lead them to their destination without having to pass at the city center. Traffic from the current network of roads in the town shall also be transferred to the Dodoma ring road in order to ease congestion within the city.
