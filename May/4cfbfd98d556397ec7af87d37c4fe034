As of April 2017, BMI Coverland forms part of the BMI Group, a Standard Industries company. BMI Group is the largest manufacturer of flat and pitched roofing and waterproofing solutions throughout Europe. From February 2019 the BMI Icopal brand is now officially available to the South African waterproofing community. BMI Icopal brings innovations like NOx-Active bitumen waterproofing membrane that absorbs nitrogen oxide (NOx) and thereby depollutes the air we breathe. In addition our ‘Metal – Faced’ bitumen membrane range extends the longevity of the bitumen membrane through the application of an embossed thermo-stable attached metal foil.
The initial BMI Icopal product offering includes Paraplast – a high performance range of Atatic Polypropylene (APP) modified bitumen torch- on membranes. The bitumen grade used to produce the Paraplast waterproofing range has good U.V resistance, elasticity, flexibility and heat resistance making the range the contractor’s choice.
The Paraplast torch-on range comprises of a 3mm APP torch-on membrane and a 4mm APP torch-on waterproofing membrane and a 4mm APP granular slate (grey) torch-on membrane. The Paraplast range of APP bitumen membranes is complimented with a bitumen surface primer to enhance bonding onto substrates and high quality silver topcoat that has a solar reflectance index (SRI) of 80.
The Paraplast waterproofing range are introduced at very competitive pricing and stock is available immediately. Please see attached datasheets.
