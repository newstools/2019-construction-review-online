The project would also involve improving drainage in Bungoma town. Lands and Urban Planning Executive Bramwel Murgor however pointed out that the project had a set of conditions, which if not met will see the bank withdraw the funding. Kenya is already embarking on 11 major roads across the country at a cost of US $1.4bn. Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) is overseeing the projects together with development partners and other financiers including the World Bank, China Exim Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In 2005, Kenya’s government decided to rebuild the country’s dilapidated roads after decades of neglect. Today, over 162,000 kilometres of Kenya’s roads are documented, and the country is currently working on recording and updating the condition of the existing network.
