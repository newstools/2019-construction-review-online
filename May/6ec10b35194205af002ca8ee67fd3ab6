Nigerian Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki has launched the rehabilitation of some township roads in Omu-Aran, Irepodun Local Government Area (LGA) of Kwara with the aim of cubing lack of good road network in the area. Saraki, represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Gbenga Makanjuola, said the project was in line with his promise to assist in alleviating the sufferings of the people of the community and urged the people to give the construction company maximum cooperation in order to ensure the speedy completion of the project.

Mr Adeyemo Ismail, the contractor handling the project, expressed his company’s readiness to complete the project in record time. “Recently, the roads were given a face lift by Makanjuola but today our joy is unquantifiable. Also deserving recognition and commendation are the street lights provided across the nooks and crannies of the community. This singular project, which has helped to illuminate every street, has also gone a long way in assisting security agencies in their patrols and surveillance,” said Dr. Bukola Saraki. The project will not only ensure the smooth flow of traffic but also promote socio-economic activities of the people, when completed. Saraki had in April 2018 hinted on the plan by the Federal Government to rehabilitate the roads under its road intervention initiative. The project was facilitated by his office as part of his efforts to boost trading and commercial activities at the grassroots.
