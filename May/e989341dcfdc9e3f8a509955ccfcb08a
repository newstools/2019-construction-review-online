Kenya’s Kisumu County government has announced plans to construct a paediatric hospital in Kombewa, Seme constituency. County Governor Nyong’o revealed the reports and said the paediatric hospital will go a long way in helping the county to achieve its goal of reducing the high burden of infectious diseases and high maternal and child mortality in the county. “The implementation of the UHC is part of our efforts to ensure our population is healthy. We are in the process of equipping our health facilities to ensure each of our seven sub-counties has a fully functional comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal facilities,”  said the Governor. “HIV prevalence is at 16.3%, 595 women die during childbirth for every 100,000 live births and 79 out of every 1,000 children die before their fifth birthday,” he added.
