The centers upon completion, will start by offering chemotherapy services and later they will be scaled to provide radiotherapy services. This comes at a time when the country lacks cancer specialists to tackle the disease with few available equipment to fight the killer disease which ranks third after Malaria and Pneumonia. KNH and Moi Referral Eldoret are the only public hospitals with cancer fighting equipment which can be used for chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. The Ministry of Health estimates that about 70 to 80% of cancer cases in the country are diagnosed in late stages when the disease has infected major body organs therefore making it incurable.
