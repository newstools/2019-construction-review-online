The government of Uganda is seeking financial assistance from China for the construction of Akii Bua olympic stadium. Janet Museveni, an official from the Ministry of Education and Sports announced the reports while appearing before parliament’s Education Committee to present their policy statement for the coming financial year 2019/2020. Alex Kakooza, the ministry of Education permanent secretary, supported the official and explained that no funds have been allocated for the stadium project in FY 2019/20. The ministry received US $176000 which was channeled to Lira district government.

Kakooza added that due to under-funding, further activities on the stadium which stands at 4% have been put on halt. “The money which had been allocated was not for construction of the stadium. The money was for preliminary works including designing of the stadium. So we’re trying to look for funding and the President requested that we make a formal proposal and application through ministry of Finance for the construction of the Akii Bua stadium to the People’s Republic of China under a grant and interest-free loan,” said Kakooza. “Due to under funding, further activities beyond preliminary works, designs, civil works and supply of stadium equipment cannot take place. Ministry of Finance is consequently exiting the project for the public investment plan for FY 2019/20 because the low funding levels cannot deliver a stadium,” he added.
