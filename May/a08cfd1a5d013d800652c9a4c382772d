The County government of Kisumu in Kenya has broken ground for the construction of a US $10m cancer center project amidst reports of increased cancer cases. Speaking during the breaking ceremony, Kisumu County Governor Prof. Anyang’ Nyong’o expressed confidence saying that early diagnosis, improved diagnostics, convenient and cheaper treatment will go a long way in fighting the third most deadly disease in the country currently. “The construction of this radiotherapy center start off our journey to establishing a modern cancer center which will be a focal point within the western circuit and the Lake Region Economic Bloc counties,” said the Governor.

Prof Nyong’o added that the county is actively looking for partners that will help materialize the ambitious project. “The specialized Cancer Center will be the first of its kind in the region and we expect it to offer comprehensive oncology services covering chemotherapy, radiotherapy and palliative care to cancer patients,” said Prof Nyong’o. In addition the center will help transform Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital into a complete referral hospital thereby cutting the need to refer patients to Eldoret Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital or to KNH. National Cancer Institutes reports that 60% of cancer patients each year require radiotherapy management which has been the case being witnessed by long queues at Kenyatta National Hospital. According to Governor Nyong’o, Kisumu and the region bears the biggest burden of cancer due to late presentation to hospital, lack of awareness, misdiagnosis and high cost of treatment.
