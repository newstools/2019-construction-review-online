The government of Zimbabwe has officially commissioned US $10m million brick and tile manufacturing plant at Sino Zimbabwe Cement Company (SZCC) on the outskirts of Gweru. The commissioning of the brick and tile manufacturing plant comes barely two weeks after the commissioning of US $62m smelter at Unki Mines. Market watchers say the commissioning of the two projects within a short space of time indicates that investors, both existing and potential, have confidence in the new administration led by President Mnangagwa.
