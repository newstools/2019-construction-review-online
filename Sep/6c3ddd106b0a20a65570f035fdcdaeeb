The new thermoplastic profiled marking has been developed for having high visibility at night time and during rainy conditions and at the same time have a similar noise level to a flat line. The Danish Road Directorate in collaboration with Geveko Markings, Eurostar, Borum and other partners have been working together to develop a new type of thermoplastic line marking. The need for a new type of marking comes after complaints from Danish locals in regards to the noise level made by profiled markings found in their vicinity. Therefore, the challenge was to develop a new line marking that has high visibility at night time and during rainy conditions and at the same time does not produce as much noise. The solution is the new thermoplastic profiled long dot marking or ViaTherm LongDot as named by Geveko Markings. The marking produces almost the same noise level as an ordinary flat line while having these much-needed visibility features for safely guiding traffic. The Long Dot markingsÂ are now being tested in several places around Denmark and we are hoping to soon see them implemented at a national level.
