The first phase of tests on key installations conducted by engineers constructing the 600MW Karuma hydropower dam located at Kiryandongo District in Western Uganda have been completed successfully. According to Mr. Li Ji, the deputy manager of Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, which is undertaking the construction works, the tests have been conducted on the intake, radial and spillway gates, as well as some turbines. “The first tests on the key equipment of the facility started at the end of July and ended last month. With the tests having been confirmed, the project now stands at 95% completion status,” said Ji.

Works on the outgoing line yard and switch-yard (GIS) as well as the transmission lines (Karuma-Lira and Karuma-Kawanda) are all 100% complete. Installation of Karuma-Olwiyo line is currently 98% complete, according to the contractor. All the civil works inside the powerhouse, dam’s intake and outfall concrete works are fully complete as well, except for the ecological ladder. The Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) said that construction of the fish ladder (a non-over flow section) is yet to be fully complete but in good course. This section will be enabling fish and other aquatic life in the dam to move freely upstream to feed and reproduce. A team of Ugandan engineers is at the moment being trained to manage the project so that upon its commissioning, they will have the know how to take on responsibilities of operations and maintenance.
