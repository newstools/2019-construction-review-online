The government of Ghana has inaugurated the Tema Community 3 Junction road. Minister for Roads and Highways, Mr. Kwesi Amoako-Atta said that the road is aimed to ease vehicular traffic flow in the Harbour area. He also hinted that the project would not be the end of the road expansion around the Port. “This became necessary owing to the expansion of the Tema Port which increased traffic flow in the enclave. We will continue into a six-lane dual-carriage road to link the new Harbour through the Tema Hospital Road to the 3-tier Motorway expansion project,,” said the Minister.
