Kenya is set to commence construction of a proposed road connecting three counties in Mt Kenya region. The Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) Regional Manager for Central, Joseph Wanjohi announced the report and said that inspections have been done in preparation for construction. The road dubbed the ‘Mau Mau road’ will follow routes which were used by freedom fighters as they accessed their hideouts at Aberdare forests. The road project will cover a distance of 120km and will run on the outskirts of the Aberdare forest. It will be 20 metres wide and will connect Nyeri, Murang’a and Nyandarua counties.

It will start at Mairi-Kinyona-Ichichi- Wanjerere- Kiamuturi and end at Kairo at the border of Murang’a and Nyeri. In Nyeri County the road will run across Othaya, Tetu and Kieni sub counties. Mr Wanjohi said that also included in the design is the 33.8km section linking Kiamara-Kangema-Kanyenya-ini and Tuthu, following a plea by Kangema MP Muturi Kigano. Upon completion the road slated to shorten the distance between the counties and open up agriculturally rich areas at the periphery of the forests. It will also ease transportation of green leaf to local factories as the route will cut across the tea belt. “While I cannot speculate about the overall impact the road will have on our sacco until it is opened, I am certain it will transform Nyeri into a 24-hour economy because the route will be open to those travelling from Nyeri and other parts of the country. Any move that minimizes the distance between two towns is welcome and if we can cut the time spent on the road this is good news. Hopefully it will be opened soon,” said Sacco Chairman James Kahiro while commending the project.
