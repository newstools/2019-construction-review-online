Phase II rehabilitation of the Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport (JMN International airport) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe is set to commence soon. This phase will include the construction of a brand new air traffic control tower and the fire station. According to Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) acting director general, Mrs Margaret Mantiziba, JMN International Airport has already undergone a major face-lift under the first phase of the rehabilitation programme and allocations have already been made for Phase II “We already have the money that will help us start Phase II of the expansion project. We are looking at the air traffic control starting off this year and we believe that in the next two years we should have completed this phase,” she added. In addition to that, Mrs Mantiziba said that over US $20m was also required to do more projects under the airport’s expansion programme. “As we improve the conditions throughout the country we will have more players wanting to ply this particular route, which is Harare-JM Nkomo International Airport or Victoria Falls-JM Nkomo,” said Mrs Mantiziba.
