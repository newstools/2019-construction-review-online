The project will be constructed 50km north of Abu Dhabi, at a cost of up to US $900m. The project is expected to be complete by 2022. The engineering, procurement, and construction contract for the power plant will be undertaken by a joint venture of Abengoa and PowerChina.

The remaining stake will belong to Abu Dhabi Power Corporation and its affiliates. Emirates Water and Electricity Company will be the off-taker for the project. The plant is expected to deliver 909,200 cubic meters of water per day to support the industries and the community at Al Taweelah and the surrounding areas. The plant will also play a role in catering to Abu Dhabi’s peak water demand, which is expected to rise by 11% between 2017 and 2024. The project will set a world record by utilizing the lowest amount of energy per gallon of desalinated water produced.
