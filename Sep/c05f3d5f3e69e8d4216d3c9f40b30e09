Plans to construct the much awaited Dongo Kundu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) are picking up pace. This is after the Kenyan government recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Japan for its implementation. The US $391m project is expected to unlock more than 60,000 jobs in Mombasa, the coastal city of Kenya However this does not mean that the project starts immediately as Kenya is still expected to sign a final print of the deal with Japan come this December after which the construction shall be set to kick off. Kenya Ports Authority Managing Director, Mr. Daniel Manduku, confirmed that a MoU was signed and he noted that the key shareholders, who in this case are the county and national governments, are working around the clock to make sure that they have a contractor on site before June next year.
