We have deliberately chosen state roads while we have started discussion with the federal government on how we can rehabilitate the many bad federal roads in the state,” said Governor Ihedioha “In order to ensure that a good job is done and to guarantee the durability of the project, painstaking processes were observed. The process of getting to this point was transparent and followed due process. All these were done to ensure not just quality assurance but value for money,” he added. The governor also flagged off the reconstruction of Government Technical College, Okporo, Orlu, Government Technical College, Owerri, Dan Anyiam Stadium and Grasshopper International Handball Stadium, Owerri. Governor Ihedioha also that the construction of both the government technical colleges, and the stadium would meet the international standards to boast technical education and sports development in the state.
