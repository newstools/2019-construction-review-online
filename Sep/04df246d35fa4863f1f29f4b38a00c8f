Yobe State government in Nigeria is set to construct a modern trailer park in Potiskum. The project will be built under the Pubic-Private Partnership in collaboration with the Nigerian Shippers’ Council. The state has provided 50 hectares of land as a site for the park and the project is expected to be completed within 18 months after the bidding processes have been finalized. According to Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, the park is meant to bring trucking business in the state under one roof and provide the opportunity for expansion and more wealth creation. “We reckoned that, as the town with possibly the highest concentration of trailer trucks in the whole of northern Nigeria, Potiskum would be a lot better if we established a park where the ever-growing trucking business is brought under one roof. Economies that do better are those that take investments in the well being of their people seriously,” he said.

Consequently, we will ensure that clean, drinkable water, electricity and access roads are provided to the site when completed, so that the truck Transit Park is ready for business from the very start,” he added. Upon completion, the project will create 5000 direct jobs. The truck Transit Park will also help decongest and clean up Potiskum and provide a modern business environment in which the town’s bourgeoning trucking sector will thrive and expand. The park will not only be used by trailer drivers but by other motorists as well who may wish to transit and enjoy the various services that will be on offer at the park. The park will also enhance the safety of cargo.
