The imposing six-storey parliament building will accommodate joint sittings of the senate and the national assembly. The two chambers will have extra facilities such as office space for the staff, parking space, 12 committee rooms and conference facilities. The new parliament is located in Mount Hampden, 18km north-west of national capital, Harare. Mt. Hampden is striving to achieve a city status that is determined not by population but by the infrastructure. The area is free from congestion and limitations from the city center and there is ample land for more infrastructure. Construction of the parliament in Mt Hampden is expected to trigger more development around the area such as banking halls, residential areas, government buildings, universities, technological centers and shopping centers. The new parliament access road is also under construction. President Mnangagwa’s vision of making Zimbabwe a middle class economy by 2030  has been the  driving force for the project. The vision emphasis more on service delivery in his government and accountability from the government officials and local authorities.
