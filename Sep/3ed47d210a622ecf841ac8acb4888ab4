It is in this same area that also three rivers from these countries meet, Mwanzamutanda, Luangwa and the mighty Zambezi River. It is also in this same area that Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique are also working towards the construction of a Y-link bridge that will create the shortest route linking up the three countries, and the bridge will also be used by heavy trucks across the Zambezi into Zambia and Mozambique.
