The federal government of Nigeria is set to commence construction of the second runway at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja. According to the minister of aviation, Hadi Sirika, provisions for the construction of the runway will be covered in the 2019 national budget. “The second runway project is in the budget and it will be procured. I will be meeting with the transaction advisers who are in town and get their baseline studies report before we move to the next stage,” he added. The minister also added that the government has decided to take up the construction of the second runway before handing it over to the concessionaire, following the high cost and will not want the current runway to dilapidate to the initial point that necessitated shutting the airport down.

Sirika noted that the second runway became very necessary, following the fact that the Airport was becoming very busy. “Operators would be on ground 20 to 30 minutes waiting to take off or even to land, which is so expensive and very inefficient,” he added. The project will be among the many transport projects that have been launched by the Federal government of Nigeria as they look forward to ensure that they streamline the transport industry. The new runway will replace the existing 27-year-old runway at the airport. When completed, the project is expected to improve the air transport system in the country by increasing the number of airlines that will be landing into the airport. Construction of the runway will help in making the airport a hub for Western Africa.
