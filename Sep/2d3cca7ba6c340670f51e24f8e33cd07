Construction works at the Kavaari earth dam which started a few months ago in Kavaari area, Mbeere North Sub County, in the Eastern region of Kenya, is now 90% complete; with the remaining work expected to be finalized by the end of this month. This was revealed by the Upper Tana Natural Resources Management Project Coordinator (UTaNRMP), Ms. Agnes Muchira while reporting to the County Development Implementation Coordination Committee (CDICC).

When the river dries up, this poor citizens are forced to walk for over 6km in order to reach the next water source,” said Ms. Muchira. “The dam will solve this problem by harvesting rain water that can be used throughout the year; this will save time used to look for water and use it in other economic activities,” she concluded. Presiding over the CDICC, Abdullahi Galgalo who is the Embu County Commissioner (CC) said that besides UTNaRM, other government agencies such as KenGen, TARDA and even the County government are coming on board in the fight against drought in the lower regions of Embu and are committed to ensure that the area residents are well supplied with water for both domestic and irrigation use. The Kavaari Development Youth Group Chairman, Albert Njagi applauded Upper Tana for enabling the project saying that it will be a game changer in the day to day life of the communities living in the proximity of the facility.
