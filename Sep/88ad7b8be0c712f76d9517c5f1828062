Construction works at the Dandora Stadium in Nairobi, Kenya have halted. Steve Ragos, one of the project managers revealed the reports and said the project has stopped due to delayed payments. “No more work going on as the contractor has parked his tools. He is demanding accrued payments for work already done before completing the project. 90% of the work has been done. The remaining bit includes laying of the artificial turf, building the gates, fitting the cabro works in and around the perimeter walls plus drilling of a borehole. We also have to equip the gym, furnish the offices and install the water pipes,” said Steve Ragos.
