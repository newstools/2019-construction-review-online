The Ondo State government in Nigeria has started construction of the 29 kilometre OkeAgbe-Irun-Afin-Ese-Ogbagi Road in Akoko Northwest area. The road project, being handled by Cappa and Dabalto Construction Company one of the leading names in the construction industry, was flagged off by the State Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure,  Mr Saka Yusuf Ogunleye. The road had been abandoned for over 20 years making it difficult for vehicles to operate in the area. The road project is expected to be completed in one year.

Township roads will also be fixed, as the department handling such matters will take care of failed portions and potholes within the towns,’’ he added. The commissioner has described the rehabilitation of roads as a dividend of good governance in the state. In addition to that, the Traditional rulers said that the road project, which has been long overdue, will be an evidence that the state too is important being beneficiaries of the governments road transformation agenda. The project will form a basis as a cogent reason for our people to support the government. Upon completion, construction of the roads will help in the development of the society. The project will also help to increase the value of lands, ease movement of farm products and other goods.
