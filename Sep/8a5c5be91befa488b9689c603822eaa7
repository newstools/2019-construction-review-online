President Paul Kagame performed the ceremony and said the facility aims to promote the country’s education and health. “The achievement we are celebrating today is in tune with Rwanda’s goals. Educations, particularly in science and technology, as well as good affordable healthcare, are the foundation of the well-being and prosperity of our citizens,” said the President. The newly inaugurated medical school sits on 22 hectares of land. It is designed to become a centre of excellence in the region, serving eleven countries, including Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Djibouti.
