Located in Giza, in the shadow of the Pyramids, the museum will bring together a collection of artifacts from 7000 years of Egyptian history, including the full Tutankhamun collection, some of which will be on public display for the first time when the museum opens in 2020. Designed by Dublin-based architects, Heneghan Peng, following a design competition that attracted 1557 entries, the building has been engineered by Buro Happold and Arup to achieve a striking concrete structure, which features multiple diagonal angles to reference the nearby Pyramids. Amongst the key design and construction challenges, was the 10,000m2 roof area, which is made up of post-tensioned folded plates and post-tensioned beams, and a cantilevered wall which extends 22m from the structure.  Following Arup’s design of the post-tensioned elements, CCL was chosen to specify, supply and install the required system as a trusted post-tensioning specialist that could meet the required quality requirements and business critical timescales for project delivery.  Working with its local agent, CSS, the company produced shop drawings for the scheme, which involved 136 XM60 multistrand post-tensioning anchors. The CCL XM60 system specified has 19 strands per tendon which provided a total of 59 tons of post-tensioned strands throughout the structure, installed using 2.71km of circular galvanised ducts.  This article will outline the challenges encountered by the CCL team in adapting the existing slab, beam and cantilever wall design to accommodate the multi-stressing anchorages required for the level of post-tensioning involved in achieving the structure. It will also detail the installation of post-tensioning works for the folded plates, edge beams, and cantilever wall, the stressing of the tendons using CCL’s multi-stressing jack and hydraulic pump, the grouting of the tendons and the technical support provided throughout the post-tensioning project.
