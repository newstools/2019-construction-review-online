Phase II construction of the iconic Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega, Kenya is set to commence. Phase I of the project was completed back in December 2017 at a cost of US $4.33m. According to Robert Makhanu, an executive committee member at the Kakamega County Social Services, Youth, culture, and sports board the site has been handed over to the contractor, Wilkori building and Construction Company, for the execution of the second phase. “This reflects the county government’s commitment, under the leadership of Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, to deliver this infrastructure development which started two years ago within the shortest time possible,” he said. “Kakamega County is fortunate to have a boss who is passionate about football and who wants to leave behind an indelible legacy in the sporting industry,” Makhanu said.

This will elevate the status of the stadium to one of the best stadiums in the East Africa region and beyond. In addition, the US $6.74m project will enable building of terraces, three mini-stadiums and construction of a modern swimming pool as well as installation of lifts. During the course of the development, the stadium will be operating normally with only the subjected areas being closed for the public. This phase is expected to end approximately three years from now so as to pave way for the third and the last phase. Upon completion, Bukhungu stadium will have conference facilities, an indoor fitness center, media center, recreational park, swimming pool, warm-up pitches, banks and shops among other facilities within its perimeter. Other than its sports and recreational amenities, the stadium’s meetings and conference centers are also expected to meet international standards.
