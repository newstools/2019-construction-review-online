The government of Ghana has announced plans to construct a new modern large airport in the Western Region to receive larger planes and serve the oil and gas community. Minister for Aviation, Mr Joseph Kofi Adda revealed the plans and said the ministry is seeking about 3,000 acres of land for the development. Mr. Kofi Adda explained that the airport project follows the influx of businesses, ostensibly from the discovery of oil and gas in the region, making the Air Force Base relatively small to contain the volume of air traffic from bigger aircraft. “The Air Force Base which was built in the 1940s to carry soldiers to Accra and beyond had undergone several rehabilitation, but the size still cannot receive larger planes. The region is so rich in all the natural resources and therefore needs an airport that would fit the status of the region,” said Mr. Kofi Adda.
