The Nalukolongo sewerage treatment plant in Uganda is set to start operations in the next three years, this is according to Uganda’s National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). The NWSC managing director Dr. Silver Mugisha said about six acres of land has already been procured for the project. “We have already acquired land and paid for it, we are now in the procurement process for it to be constructed,” said Dr. Mugisha who was speaking during the annual Institute of Certified Public Accountants conference in Entebbe. “In the next two to three years the plant will be able to drain Rubaga, parts of Mutundwe and Kabowa,” he added. Additionally, the plant will host and treat the waste in-house, unlike the Kinawataka pre-treatment plant that pumps sewerage for final treatment at Bugolobi. “The Nalukongo plant will be self-contained, it will receive and finish treatment there. One advantage we have is that there is a swap nearby, therefore, you treat sewerage up to a certain level then release it to the swamp which does the final treatment,” Dr. Mugisha explained.

A project appraisal report by African Development Fund (AfDB) in 2017 highlighted the need for the government to expand the country’s sewer system which only covers 7.5% of the total population. The government of Uganda has constructed several sewage plants with funding from the ADB. They include the Lubiigi treatment plant constructed in 2014, Bugolobi and Kinawataka pretreatment plant. A new plant will also be constructed in Kajansi to treat about 135m liters of water alongside a sewage plant in order to improve the country’s sewerage system.
