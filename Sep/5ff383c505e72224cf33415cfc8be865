Security officers have been facing serious housing problems for a long time. The officers are living in deplorable conditions in small units which are not suitable for them and their big families. The security institutions houses, which were built decades ago, have gone for years without maintenance and they keep on deteriorating, especially with hail storms and other harsh weather conditions the country is experiencing year in, year out.
