The government of Zimbabwe is seeking funding from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for four major road projects. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza confirmed the report and said the external funding would complement Government’s budgetary commitment to infrastructure development. The four major road projects include construction of missing links on Harare Drive, Phase 2 of the Airport Road, Birchenough Bridge and Chirundu Highway. This also includes completion of the remaining 13,5 kilometres of the 21km stretch on the accident-prone Makuti-Chirundu Road earmarked for improvement after Japan poured in US $21m for the first 6,5km. The missing links of Harare Drive alone will cost US $110m.
