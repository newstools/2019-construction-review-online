The government of Tanzania led by President John Magufuli inaugurated the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation Building built by China Railway Construction Engineering Group (CRCEG) at cost of US $150m. The 30-story building was developed to honour the legacy of Tanzania’s founding leader, Julius Nyerere. The development has a total construction area of 63,000 square meters and is home to a five-star hotel with 256 bedrooms and suites, 7,000 square meters of offices, 2,000 square meters of commercial retail areas and supporting facilities such as conference centres and parking lots. The project is a partnership between Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation, a non-governmental organisation which owns the land and will occupy some of the offices, and the CRJE Estate Ltd, a fully owned subsidiary of the China Railway Jianchang Engineering Company. CRJE Estate will manage the project for 20 years under a build, operate and transfer arrangement.

This has resulted to the country achieving great success in economic development, especially in combating corruption, improving infrastructure and social delivery,” Wang Ke added.
