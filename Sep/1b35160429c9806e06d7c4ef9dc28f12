The project has been designed to give give worshipers an ambiance for their vehicles to ramp down to the basement car parks and will sit designer for their convenience. Italian Civil Engineering Giant, Cappa & D’Alberto Plc is the project contractor of the development. Upon completion the church complex will host the Latter Rain Assembly’s international headquarters. In 2016, Bakare hosted in Lagos a fundraising event for the completion of the ultra-modern worship complex with the likes of his friend and Governor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-Rufai and other dignitaries in attendance. He committed much of his privately-earned income into the completion of The Citadel. The church’s present expansive assembly at Akilo Road in Ogba, Lagos, which is their only branch in Lagos, would remain there, though, Bakare’s Latter Rain Assembly does not believe in replication of church branches.
