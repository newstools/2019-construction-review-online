The government of Australia and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) have approved up to US $6.3m funding to Hazer Group Limited (Hazer) for the construction and operation of a groundbreaking world’s hydrogen production facility in Munster, Western Australia. The 100 ton per annum project will use technology developed by Sydney-listed Hazer Group Ltd. Hazer aims to complete construction of the facility by December 2020 and begin operations in January 2021.

However, Hazer’s process represents an alternative way to produce hydrogen using biogas sourced from wastewater treatment plants. If successful, this project will offer opportunities to replicate the technology across other treatment plants and landfill sites across Australia,” he added. Hazer will sell the renewable hydrogen for industrial applications and is exploring markets for graphite including carbon black, activated carbon and battery anode applications. Hazer also aims to take advantage of waste or low value biogas streams such as from wastewater treatment plants, landfill sites and other industrial locations to produce higher value hydrogen and graphite. The project will be constructed at the Woodman Point Wastewater Treatment Plant, owned by Western Australian Water Corporation (WA Water Corporation) where the company has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with WA Water Corporation for the supply of biogas and to provide the project site for construction. Upon completion, the project will offer opportunities to replicate the technology across other treatment plants and landfill sites across Australia.
