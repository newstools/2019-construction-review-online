The government of Zimbabwe has released US $46m to the District Development Fund (DDF) for the construction of 600 boreholes in the country’s eight rural provinces. The funds will also cater for the rehabilitation of hand-pumps to restore their efficiency and productivity. According to DDF director of water supplies and maintenance, Mr Edwin Toriro, the projects which are being jointly undertaken with the Ministry of Health and Child Care, will be biased towards drought-prone areas. “Each province will have a total of 60 boreholes and they will assist locals on the water crisis. We are doing this as per Presidential Declaration in terms of the District Development Fund Act,” he said. “We are also going to drill boreholes close to irrigation schemes. With the community support under public works programme, hand-pump rehabilitation is being applied as well in all provinces. Moreso, an exercise of borehole flushing is being carried out. This exercise involves flushing out dirt and debris using compressed air. The blowing out will restore the productivity of the borehole. More projects are on their way. Funds have also been allocated for setting up irrigations schemes,” he added.

The scope of the new reinvigorated projects also includes fixing old boreholes and assisting irrigation schemes, public hospitals, Government buildings, as well as urban areas. Upon completion, the project will provide clean water for consumption and irrigation. DDF programmes undertaken so far this year includes rehabilitation of infrastructure damaged by Cyclone Idai. The works were undertaken in Masvingo, Midlands, Mashonaland East, Matabeleland South and North and Masvingo provinces.
