Construction of Anomabo Sea Defence wall in Ghana is set to commence. The Central Regional Minister, Kwamena Duncan announced the reports and said that preparatory works are underway. He pointed out that the 5km sea defense aims to halt tidal wave devastation in the coastal community and adjoining ones. ” The “Anomabo Coastal Protection Project” is envisaged to curtail ongoing erosion of the beach that has paved the way for the sea to destroy several houses in the Mfantseman municipality with many others currently at risk,” said Kwamena Duncan.

The company has already cleared part of the Anomabo beach of debris and graded the area and has started piling on site, rocks that would be used for the construction. He said other coastal protection projects were at various stages of completion along the Kafodzidzi to Elmina seafront in the Komenda-Edina- Eguafo-Abirem Municipality. Mr Duncan said the project would create direct and indirect employment for residents of the area and boost local economy as soft materials would be acquired from the region. He charged the company to deliver on its promise without compromising on quality work. Construction of sea defence works is currently one of the Government’s Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing highest priority projects. The implementation of the coastal erosion projects would aim at protecting beaches and its environs against encroachment by the sea, arresting environmental deterioration as well as mitigating the negative social and economic consequences of the beach erosion.
