Construction works at the Kashimbila Multipurpose Dam are 90% complete. This was revealed by Nigerian Minister of Energy, Sale Mamman after he paid a visit to the ongoing project in Takum, Taraba State, Nigeria. The dam was initially designed with an installed capacity of 18MW, however, following the detailed hydrological modelling and yield analysis carried out by Aurecon, a 40MW installed capacity was recommended, which was accepted and implemented.The multipurpose dam will have the capacity to generate electricity, a water treatment plant capable of supplying 60,000 cubic meters of water to about 400,000 people, irrigation facility of about 2,000 hectares and an airstrip. According to Sale Mamman the commissioning of the project was simply delayed by the construction of an electricity evacuation line. “The multipurpose dam will cover the electricity needs of about 80% population in areas like Doga, Wukari, Takum, Kashimbila and many other communities in the Northeast and Yandev in Benue state who are not yet connected to the grid; and also support agricultural ventures in surrounding states in the Northeast. ” he added. The facility will also irrigate 3,000 hectares of plantations, particularly in the dry season.

Once completed the project will create 39,887 jobs while over 100,000 persons will benefit socially and economically.The project will regulate the river’s flow, thus preventing flooding that threatens 6 million people, mainly in the states of Taraba, Benue, Cross River, Kogi and Delta. The Kashimbilla dam has also been designed to accommodate tourism.
