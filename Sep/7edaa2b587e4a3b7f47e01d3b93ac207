Construction of a cement plant in West Pokot county has been delayed due to logistical headwinds. This is after a new investor came on board to implement the project that has been on the cards for the last 10 years. The new investor Simba Cement which acquired Cemtech Company says it needs one year to enable them to prepare well enough before it starts constructing the factory at the limestone-rich Ortum location. The company will also carry out public participation and hold consultative forums with residents and leaders of the area; this is after the company received its approval license to construct the factory. According to Mr. John Munyes, Mining and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary, construction of the factory will take approximately 18 months. Mr. Munyes was accompanied by Simba Cement Managing Director Narendra Raval. Some of the areas Simba Cement has been given rights to operate include Chepkol, Iyon, Puseli, Sebiit, Marich, and Ortun. Originally Cemtech company was issued with the license to construct the plant on the 650 acres of freehold land 10 years ago for US $1.2m.

Governor Lonyangapuo assured his constituents that their land will not be sold out for mining activities but rather will be leased to supply raw materials to sustain operations of the cement factory. “By giving out the license, this does not amount to selling the land but leasing it purposely for mining minerals within the Ortum belt,” said the governor adding that the investment will help reduce poverty levels in the county.
