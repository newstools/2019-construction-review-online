Sokkia has introduced the latest addition to its GNSS integrated receiver line, the GRX3, which is designed to provide a smaller, lighter and fully integrated GNSS solution. AlokSrivastava, director of product management at Sokkia, said, “The multi-constellation GRX3 receiver is built to offer a complete and versatile solution to provide best-in-class positioning performance for a wide variety of precision applications.” “Whether using the receiver for GNSS post-processed surveying, or RTK using wireless technologies including network RTK option with a cellular-equipped field computer, a SiteComm™ RTK rover, or paired with a Sokkia total station for Fusion Positioning™, the GRX3 provides the most advanced and powerful GNSS technology available in a more compact and lightweight housing that can withstand the harshest of environmental conditions,” he added. “Combine it with one of Sokkia’s data collectors and field software for maximum versatility and convenience, increasing fieldwork efficiency from start to finish,” he stated. The receiver features Sokkia Tilt technology, which includes a 9-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) and ultra-compact eCompass designed to compensate for measurements taken out of plumb by as much as 15 degrees. “The GRX3 is designed as a ‘future-proof’ solution with an advanced GNSS chipset with Universal Tracking Channels™ technology that automatically tracks signals from all available and planned constellations — including GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou, IRNSS, QZSS, SBAS,” he explained. The receiver has been tested to meet IP67 certification for protection against harsh environmental weather conditions.
