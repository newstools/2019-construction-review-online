The museum will also exhibit the freshly discovered Toto cemetery, which was recently unveiled in Sohag. “This museum will feature a variety of artifacts that reflect the history of all the Egyptian capitals from the ancient to the modern as well as the country’s cultural past,” said Waziri. The Supreme Council of Antiquities is responsible for the organization of the full security of the museum, the design of the showrooms, and the selection of artifacts to be displayed in addition to setting them up. The NAC’s district (city) of Arts and Culture will also be home to a new opera house that sits on 86,000 square meters of land accommodating up to 2,200 individuals. Within its perimeter, the city also has a 9,000 square meter central library and a number of buildings for music, cinema, painting and sculpture, in addition to a wide range of restaurants and various services for visitors. The construction of the city started more than a year ago upon the request of President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. The initial projects timetable was 7 years but it was revised to 2 years.
