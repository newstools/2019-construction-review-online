The government of Ghana is set to construct over 500km railway line from Elubo in the Western Region to Aflao in the Volta Region. The long term project forms part of the Trans-Ecowas which is expected to enhance transport services and promote economic activities in the corridor. Currently, the ongoing works on the ground include feasibility studies and other engagements that would ensure that the project is implemented successfully in phases. According to the Minister of Railways Development Mr. Joe Ghartey the government will start sourcing for funds from investors and other financiers after the completion of the feasibility studies. The line from Takoradi to Accra will link the Central Region to the Western and Greater Accra regions and will further open up the area for employment opportunities, therefore addressing the growing problem of unemployment in the country.

Touching on the introduction of the Free Senior High School (SHS) by the Akufo-Addo led administration, Mr. Ghartey said the development had come at the right time to help those who could not raise funds for their school fees. Moreover, he challenged students to work hard and take advantage of the newly introduced free SHS policy. Speaking at the event the Paramount Chief of the Oguaa Traditional Area, Osaberima Kwesi Atta II also appealed to the government to address developmental challenges in the area and also ensure equitable share of the revenue. Mr. Kwesi expressed optimism in the ongoing reconstruction works at the Cape coast town roads which are currently being done under the administration of President Akufo-Addo.
