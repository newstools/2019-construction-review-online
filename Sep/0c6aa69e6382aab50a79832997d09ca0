The Delta State government in Nigeria has set aside US $2m for the rehabilitation of degraded federal roads in the state. According to the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, some of the roads to be rehabilitated by the state government include Benin-Sapele, Benin-Onitsha and Agbor-Abraka-Eku roads. “These are all federal roads but, the good news is that the Federal Government has reached out to us to repair these roads and we are very optimistic that by the time we are done, the Federal Government will attend to us for the purpose of refunds. We are more concerned with the safety of our people and that is why we are committed to fixing these roads which will take more than US $2m,” he said.

Mr. Aniagwu said more than 10 camps will be set up depending on the impact of the impending flood on the people. Upon completion, the road projects development will reduce passenger travel times, vehicle operating costs and traffic related fatalities on targeted federal roads.
