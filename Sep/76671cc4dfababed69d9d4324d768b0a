The government of Uganda, through the Ministry of Health, is set to upgrade 62 Health Centre IIs in the country to Health Centre IIIs. This comes after the government received a loan from the World Bank to fund the Uganda Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer (UgIFT) Program for Results (P4R).

It addresses three constraints that have a major adverse impact on service delivery: (a) the large-scale horizontal inequities in the per capita amounts of transfers received by the Local Governments; (b) the inadequate level of per capita social expenditures in poorer Local Governments; and (c) the poor fiscal management of resources by Local Governments. The Ministry of Health has so far publicized a tender notice welcoming bids from eligible bidders for the project. Interested parties are supposed to place their bids starting from the end of this month and before 29th day of October after which the bids shall be evaluated within 40 working days and the best evaluated bidder announced within 5 working days from Contracts Committee award.

The project consists of construction of a General Ward, Improvement of Out-Patient Department, building of two twin Staff houses, construction of Lined VIP latrine, Placenta Pit, Medical Waste Pit, and General External works in all the 62 health centers.
