The Federal Government of Nigeria has announced that repair works are set to resume on the Third Mainland Bridge. Federal Controller of Works in Lagos State, Mr. Adedamola Kuti said that results of investigative tests on the bridge were ready and that contractors will move to site at the completion of the traffic management strategy. “Once I get our traffic plans approved, work will soon begin on Third Mainland Bridge. Meanwhile, we have already completed the resurfacing and the markings, such that you can now drive on Third Mainland Bridge smoothly. We are also going to repair some of the piles or pillars carrying the bridge; that is the next phase that we are doing,” said Mr. Kuti. The Third Mainland Bridge is the longest of three bridges connecting Lagos Island to the mainland, the other are the Ekoand Carter bridges. It was the longest bridge in Africa until 1996 when The 6th October Bridge located in Cairo was completed. The bridge starts from Oworonshoki which is linked to the Apapa-Oshodi express way and Lagos-Ibadan express way, and ends at the Adeniji Adele Interchange on Lagos Island.

The investigative maintenance test done is expected to enable the contractors assess the true state of the bridge after which works will commence. The Third Mainland Bridge is an essential part of Lagos’ daily commuting, and as such requires to be constantly renovated. It has also come to be a major Lagos icon, offering different views of Lagos – the Lagos Lagoon, the University of Lagos Waterfront and Makoko, a shanty town built on the Lagos Lagoon.
