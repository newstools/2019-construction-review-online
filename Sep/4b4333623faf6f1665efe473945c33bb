Renovation works on Nairobi City Stadium in Kenya has commenced. Nairobi County Governor Mike Sonko revealed the reports and said the plan is to ensure the historic stadium is upgraded to the required standards. The Kenya’s oldest stadium which served as the home ground of Gor Mahia, has been in disuse since 2016 when the Kenyan Premier League’s Stadia Safety and Security Committee blacklisted it.

The committee thereafter found the facility unfit to host league matches because it was not only in a poor state but was also a health hazard. The renovation of the City Stadium includes; replacement of the astroturf (the current artificial turf at the stadium was installed in 2008 by the world’s body Fifa), redoing the running tracks, construction of terraces and changing rooms. Other facilities will  that will be featured include; a VIP lounge (to be installed), refurbished washrooms, new street lights and a squash court. Also to be erected is a perimeter wall for enhanced security and there is a proposal for a gymnasium with rooms for indoor games. “My administration is determined to promote sports through development of infrastructure to enable our youth nurture their talents. Three other stadia would be erected in Ziwani (Kariokor), Ndurarawa (Riruta) and Kihumbuini (Kangemi). Already, the county is doing final touches on Dandora Stadium,” said Sonko. The stadium upon completion of the upgrade, is likely to host 2019-2020 SportPesa Premier League matches for the first time since it was banned. Judith ‘Nyangi’ Anyango, Organizing secretary of KPL champions Gor Mahia said that the team will start using the pitch for training immediately before the terraces washroom and gym are done.
