For instance numerous medium-sized companies and qualified specialist dealers, as well as well-known, globally operating German and European corporations rely on Bänninger products. Innovative products, optimized for the respective application, are the requirement for “carefree” installations in pressure applications. Planners and end-user all over the world benefit from the continuous innovations of their development team toward more safety, reality and sustainability. The unique aspects of their products are based on company’s specificity: from the raw material to finished products. Entire process is controlled and certified by various institutes all over the world thus maintaining production standards. Their production method and machines correspond to the newest technology. Therefore, they guarantee their customers, to get what they intent to buy. The company has a high degree of materials expertise. They have a team of experts who monitors and test every batch with aim of constantly optimizing the material properties of their products. Their dedication to quality covers all areas of the company. Bänninger is certified according to DIN EN ISO 9001 and DIN EN ISO 50001. The high quality standard allows a 10-year warranty on all products that they manufacture. State-of-the-art and integrated, controlled production plants ensure secure and efficient processes. They enable an impressive range of products such as: small parts, as well as elements with an injection weight of up to 150 kg and clamping force of up to 3,000 tons. Their extrusion plants produce pipes up to a diameter of 630 mm. The company produces the following products in different dimension ranging from 8 – 1000 mm for a wide variety of molded parts. PVC has increased heat deflection, chemical resistance and is particularly resistant to chlorine attacks. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is an amorphic thermoplastic resin, RAL7011. • DIN EN 1452
• Corresponds to the KTW recommendation of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA)   • Good resistance to chemicals
• Weather resistance
• Excellent processing capability
• Flame retardancy • Bonding The polyethylene injection moulded fittings are characterized by excellent physical and mechanical properties. This results in diverse applications. Through the fine surface structure, PE moulded fittings are an ideal material for transporting gases and fluids. The excellent UV-resistance offers the possibility of outdoor installations without the effort of additional protective measures. Our moulded fittings have been proven for decades in gas and water supply. Polyethylene (PE100) classified according to the minimum long-term strength (MRS), colour black. • EN 1555 for the gas supply
• EN 12201 for the drinking water supply • Low net weight
• UV resistance
• High resistance to chemicals
• High impact strength at low temperatures
• Corrosion resistance
• Light and weather resistant
• High abrasion resistance
• Excellent processing behavior • Electrofusion
• Buttfusion
• Flange connection Compared to PE, PP-R has higher rigidity, particularly in the upper temperature range. The high resistance to chemicals and good long-term properties compared to many other materials, even at high temperatures, are characteristic for PP-R. PP-R (Polypropylene-Random-Copolymerisate) with high molecular weight and high-heat stabilized, RAL 6017 May green. • DIN EN ISO 15874
• DVGW (German Association for Gas and Water Applications)
• Corresponds to the KTW recommendation of the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA) • Good resistance to chemicals
• Weather resistant
• Excellent processing • Heating element socket welding
• Heating coil socket welding
• Heating element butt welding A new generation of material, thanks to its structure, pipes and fittings can be produced with higher hydraulic capacity or with higher compressive strength. This means that – for the same application case – if the pipes are produced with thinner walls, they have higher flow capacity with a consistent outer diameter. In contrast, PP-RCT pipe can be subject to higher pressures than the previous PP-R pipes, with the same outer diameter and the same wall thickness. Polypropylene-random-copolymer with a modified crystalline structure and increased temperature resistance, RAL 6024 traffic green. • DIN EN ISO 15874
• DIN 8077/ 8078
• Corresponds to the KTW recommendation of the Federal Health Agency (BGA).
• WRAS
• NSF • Good resistance to chemicals
• Weather-resistant
• Excellent processing capability • Socketfusion
