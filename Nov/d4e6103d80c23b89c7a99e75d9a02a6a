Nigeria is set to complete the construction of 10 power generation plants to improve the volume of electricity being generated in the country. The project is being undertaken by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC). The General Manager, Environment and Community Relations of NDPHC, Eze Odigbo, disclosed this at the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Scoping Workshop of the Akurba 330/132KV Substation Project in Lafia, Nasarawa State. Odigbo revealed that out of the 10 power generation plants embarked upon by the company, eight have been completed, while the remaining two are under construction. He however explained that the reason why the 10 power generation plants are all sited in the southern part of the country was because of the availability of gas in that part of the country which is at the moment not found in the north. He stated that the company has also constructed 121 transmission/substations across the country, even as he added that the NDPHC has as well carried out 291 projects for the distribution of the energy generated to consumers with one of the projects sited in Lafia, Nasarawa State.

Modibo enumerated some benefits derivable by the state from the Akurba substation to include rapid growth in the socio-economic activities by way of attracting foreign investors who will in turn create jobs which will eventually change the standard of living of residents in the state.
