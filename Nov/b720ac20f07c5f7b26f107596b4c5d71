Negotiations for the construction of Port Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line project in Nigeria has begun. Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi made the announcement and said the negotiations are between Nigeria and the Chinese government. The project which seeks US $15bn loan has been delayed due to lack of funds. Eastern rail line connects Port Harcourt in the Niger Delta to Maiduguri in the northeastern state of Borno, near the border with Chad.
