The Nairobi County government has received more than US $4.2m in conditional grant to rehabilitate roads in the county. The grant from the Kenya Roads Board is part of the funds released to county governments every year. The 2018 County Allocation of Revenue and the 2012 Public Finance Management Acts mandate the State agency to release funds to county governments annually. For Nairobi, the money was to be released in the financial year that ended on June 30 but it delayed due to the devolved government not complying with the requirements for benefiting from the grant. “The funds are to be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of the KRB Act. You are required to use the funds in line with the 2018/19 approved financial year work plan submitted to the board,” KRB Executive Director Jacob Ruwa said.

Kimoondo Road, which links Kware Ward and Pipeline estate is almost complete. The same applies to Kobil-Kware Road,” Governor Sonko said. In its 2018/19 Public Roads Programme, the agency said the county government requires US $150m to rehabilitate and upgrade 609.79km road network. Mr Ruwa said the projects would be financed by national government, though the city devolved unit would be expected to meet 15% of the cost. Out of the 3, 600km of the road network under the Nairobi City County government, only 50% is tarmacked, Some 20% gravelled while the remaining 30 are earth.
