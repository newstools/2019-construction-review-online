The construction of the Out Patient Department (OPD) ward at Eria Health Centre IV in Moyo Sub-county, Moyo District, in Uganda has stalled for seven months over lack of funds. Construction commenced in November 2018. The project that was awarded to Iron Investment and Construction Ltd, a construction firm based in Arua District, was supposed to end in March this year. District officials have revealed that they have so far released US $3.4m out of the US $4m needed for the completion of the project. Mr Alex Chelimo, the Moyo District chief administrative officer, stated that it is true the work has stalled for over seven months and they have written warning letters to the contractor twice but he did not respond. “We may be forced to seek the advice of the Solicitor General,” he said. “What is now remaining is grinding the stones, putting bulbs, painting and working on some of the cracks in some of the rooms,” he added.

Mr Williams Anyama, the Moyo District chairperson, said the contractor has deprived the locals of service delivery. “How can government entertain this kind of people? The contractor cannot do this at the expense of ordinary people. We care about the people and the project must be completed,” he said.
