The government of Ghana has announced plans to construct a Neurosurgical Hospital for the treatment of brain-related diseases to improve neurological healthcare. Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia revealed the report and said that the government will work with the President of the Chinese Neurosurgical Board, Professor Ling Feng towards the establishment of the project. Dr Bawumia added that the facility will be the first of its kind in the West African sub-region upon completion. The range of service, quality and focus of the hospital project will offer unique and rare service not only in Ghana but in West Africa as a region. “Unfortunately, advanced neurological treatments are not available in West Africa because of the absence of such state-of-the-art facilities and this will be good for Ghana. We are going to move quickly to ensure the construction and operation of this neuroscience hospital,” said Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.

This is according to Dr Kafui Tamakloe, a Neurosurgeon at the Cocoa Clinic in Accra. The few neurosurgical institutions in the country were also poorly equipped to provide the needed health services being demanded. “More than 80% of health problems treated in the neurosurgical units are spine cases or the degenerative disc disease. Wear and tear of the spine affects the discs, bones, joints and ligaments of the spine. The facility will really come in handy if constructed. It will not only boost employment but improve the health sector of our country,” said Dr Kafui Tamakloe.
