Construction of the Ngoma stadium is one of the three new district stadiums in the Eastern province that the Rwanda Housing Authority (RHA) announced will be constructed. This is in line with the government’s seven-year programme to promote sports. The Nyagatare, Bugesera and Ngoma stadiums will be built to accommodate 3000 people each. Guy Rurangayire, Director of Sports at the Ministry for Sports, said that the football pitches were completed first in order to host league matches this season, and the remaining works are in advanced stages. Upon completion, the stadium will greatly contribute to talent development and sports promotion in Ngoma. It has already generated over 400 jobs in the district over the construction duration. “We are really happy about this project as we have been waiting for this stadium for so long and we are expecting to have a good stadium with good standards and we look forward to seeing the local community, especially youth, benefiting from it as a source of employment during the construction and a place to nurture their talents in different sporting disciplines once the facility is completed,” said Guy Rurangayire.
