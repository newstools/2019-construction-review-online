The government of Benin has received US $133m grant from the African Development Bank (AfDB) to finance two projects, one for the production of sanitation services in Cotonou, the country’s capital, and the other for the electrification of rural areas. Benin’s Minister of Economy and Finance, Romuald Wadagni who signed the loan agreement with AfDB Resident Representative in Benin, John Andrianrisata said the funds will be used to finance rainwater drainage and sanitation in Cotonou City and rural electrification.

The rural electrification project is expected to increase the rate of access to electricity in rural areas from 8.11% in 2018 to 9.74% in 2022. To date, Benin has had little experience with independent power producers (IPPs) and off-grid companies but has demonstrated clear interest in opening its power sector to private investment. Rural drinking water and sanitation coverage in Benin is relatively low, and is
estimated at 36% and 14% respectively. Despite heavy current and past investments, the
achievement of the millennium development goals requires not only the implementation of avast DWSS programme for the 2004-2015 period, but also institutional capacity building in the sector. The Government of Benin and ADF submited the programme to the donor
community for financing. Furthermore, the ADF will finance the first sub-programme, and
play a leading role in mobilising the necessary financial resources.
