DSPA (dry sprinkler powder aerosol) generators are innovative fire extinguishing and suppression tools designed to be used on class A, B, C and F (K) fires. DSPA generators are non-pressurized and do not deplete oxygen when extinguishing a fire. They are more efficient and effective than conventional systems, they are non-corrosive and non-conductive, are friendly to the environment and not harmful to humans or animals. The aerosol expands volumetrically upon activation, flooding an area and knocking down flames immediately while reducing heat from as high as 700°C. This makes it safe for responders and fire marshals to effectively save lives and property. DSPA products are distributed by DSPA KENYA FIRE SYSTEMS, a fire solutions company that strives to provide exceptional value to its customers with an intense focus on quality, reliability, and services while providing innovative products.  The DSPA 5 aerosol generator can be used by firefighters and professional first responders as a highly effective knockdown tool against fires. It is deployed manually into a room or compartment that requires firefighting. The DSPA 5 generator is recommended for firefighting in buildings and other structures. It can be used in every fire stage, but its value is best displayed during fully developed fires.  DSPA fixed extinguishing systems combine the unique technology of DSPA Aerosol generators with high-quality fire panels and accessories from Labor & Strauss (LST).  Highly trained engineers design complete systems that will include a combination of sensors, DSPA aerosol generators, and other components, based on customer unique needs.  For smaller applications like switchgear, electrical cabinets, small transformer stations, and cargo containers, DSPA offers a simple, yet multi-functional standalone solution for fire detection and extinguishing using the Nofiq FMD (Fire Management Device). DSPA products can be a big difference in ensuring occupational safety! DSPA in use
