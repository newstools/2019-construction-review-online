Zimbabweâ€™s acute water shortage is a result of a particularly bad drought this year, a symptom of climate change. Poor water management has wasted much of the water that remains. To curb the situation the government is also drilling 600 boreholes nationwide. 60 boreholes will be drilled in each province and will be biased towards drought-prone areas. Four boreholes per parliamentary constituency are also being repaired using funds provided by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement under the Water Fund. More than 100 boreholes will be drilled in areas such as Muzarabani, Mangwe, Chiredzi, Kanyemba, Mukumbura, Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe, Tsholotsho and Binga, which experience water problems seasonally. Upon completion, the project will provide clean water for consumption and irrigation.
