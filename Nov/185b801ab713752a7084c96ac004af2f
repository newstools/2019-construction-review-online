The Kisumu County Government in Kenya has recently issued a call for tenders for the installation of solar power off-grid systems to supply public utility infrastructure. The county government has announced that it will give priority to public-private partnerships (PPPs) for this project. Several public utility structures will soon be operating with solar mini-grids in Kisumu County, in western Kenya. These include hospitals, markets, street lighting and water pumps. Off-grid solar installations should have a minimum capacity of 5kWp. Interested companies have until November 26, 2019 to express their interest. The Kisumu County authorities wish to implement a public-private partnership (PPP) for the construction of these facilities. A call for tenders has been issued by the Kisumu County Government for off-grid suppliers. Off-grids will support the national network that supplies only 46% of the population of this county in western Kenya.

This will be the green energy produced by the Olkaria V geothermal power plant. Its owner, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), has recently commissioned the two units of this geothermal power plant located in the Rift Valley. In addition, the Indian company Kalpataru Power Transmission and two Chinese companies, Shanghai Sieyuan Electric and Nari Group, are currently building the Olkaria-Lessos-Kisumu transmission line. It will be 300km long and will display a voltage of 220 kV/400 kV, replacing a defective 132 kV line. According to Fernandes Barasa, the CEO of KETRACO, by July 2019, 95% of the work had been completed. According to him, they will be delivered in March 2019. In the meantime, the off grids that will be installed in hospitals, markets and for street lighting will reduce the local government bill.
