The city has a water tower that currently produces 3,000 cubic meters of water per day. In its national strategy, Gabon aims to increase the rate of access to drinking water from 45% to 95% in urban areas and to 85% in rural areas. To achieve these objectives, the country benefited from financial support from the African Development Bank (AfDB), which financed a US $75.4m project to renew Librevilleâ€™s drinking water supply network.
