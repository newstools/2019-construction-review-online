The construction contract is in the sum of US $8m including Value Added Tax (VAT). The project will be completed in 96 weeks. Once the office is completed, it will provide a comfortable and clean environment for the staff to bolster morale as well as increase productivity. The council also approved US $6m for the consultancy work for three different categories of professional work for the three office buildings. According to the Minister of Finance Zainab Ahmed, the NDIC zonal office in Bauchi has been operating from a rented office which has not been a good working environment. “The corporation will also be saving money by building the office,” she added.
