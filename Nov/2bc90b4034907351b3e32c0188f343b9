Egypt has officially commissioned the largest wind energy farm in the country. The 262.5MW wind energy farm has been developed in partnership with Ras Ghareb Wind Energy, Toyota Tsusho/Eurus Energy Holdings and Orascom Construction in Ras Ghareb on the Gulf of Suez. The US $380m wind energy farm is owned 40% by ENGIE Africa, 40% by Toyota Tsusho and the rest 20% by Orascom. Funded by the Japan Bank of International Corporation, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Société Générale; the plant is expected to help the country to achieve its goal of generating 7GW of the country’s energy from wind by 2022.

Ras Ghareb Wind Energy has been developed with a continuous focus on health and safety and is completely in line with ENGIE’s ambition in the zero-carbon transition. “We are committed to applying the same standards with the same success for the adjacent 500 MW wind farm that is being developed by this consortium,” he added. The plant was completed 45 days ahead of scheduled and will provide energy to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company as part of a 20-year power purchase agreement. Egypt has outstanding wind energy conditions. Particularly in the coastal regions, high and stable wind speeds are frequent (up to an average of 10.5 m/s in the Gulf of Suez). Furthermore, the country’s large deserts and abundant thinly populated areas are well suited for the construction of large wind farms. Within the scope of the Renewable Energy Strategy, 12 % of total electricity supply by 2020 are to be generated by wind power, translating into more than 7 200MW of grid connected wind farms.
