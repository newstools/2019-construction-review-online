Flotex is a unique textile floor covering that combines the hard wearing and durable characteristics of a resilient floor with the quality, warmth and comfort of a carpet, bacterial cultures such as E-Coli, MRSA and moulds such as athletes foot fungi. The unique construction of Flotex flocked flooring is what allows to release soiling like no other textile flooring. Unlike the looped and twisted fibers of a conventional carpet tile, the smooth straight fibres of Flotex do not trap particles of soil, allowing them to be removed without difficulty during cleaning. Most spills can be cleaned with plain water. The dense flocked surface of Flotex provides an ideal acoustic barrier for both ambient and contact sound up to over 20dB – providing comfort and ambiance inside the room as well as to those rooms located below. Furthermore the R12 slip resistance rating of Flotex prevents slips and trips, meeting commercial safety requirements. Flotex’s unique construction allows for superior appearance retention, long after your floors have been installed. The premium nylon 6.6 fibres used in Flotex achieve outstanding levels of colour fastness. What’s more, with over 70 million of these fibres per square metre which is nine times denser than commercial tufted carpet, Flotex sheet is resistant to flattening, fraying and gapping. Completely waterproof and washable Flotex is fully waterproof and can be cleaned by using water and a simple detergent. For most staining, simple household soap is enough to clean the product, while other detergent clean away ink, oil and more severe stains. The wide array of colours and designs in which Flotex is offered, remain as vibrant and livery as the day the floor was installed.
