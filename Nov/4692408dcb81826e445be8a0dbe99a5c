Four boreholes per parliamentary constituency are also being repaired using funds provided by the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Climate and Rural Resettlement under the Water Fund. More than 100 boreholes will be drilled in areas such as Muzarabani, Mangwe, Chiredzi, Kanyemba, Mukumbura, Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe, Tsholotsho and Binga, which experience water problems seasonally. Upon completion, the project will provide clean water for consumption and irrigation. Earlier this year the government had US $46m to the DDF towards the project. The funds will also cater for the rehabilitation of hand-pumps to restore their efficiency and productivity. “We are also going to drill boreholes close to irrigation schemes. With community support under public works programme, hand-pump rehabilitation is being applied as well in all provinces. Moreso, an exercise of borehole flushing is being carried out. This exercise involves flushing out dirt and debris using compressed air. The blowing out will restore the productivity of the borehole. More projects are on their way. Funds have also been allocated for setting up irrigation schemes,” said Monica Mutsvangwa.
