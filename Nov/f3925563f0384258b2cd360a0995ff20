The rehabilitation of the Nyendo-Bukakkata road in Uganda has been delayed by heavy rainfall and delay in the release of funds according to engineers tasked with the project. The government of Uganda had earlier promised to tarmac the 41km road that has been in bad condition for the last two decades; actual construction began in June 2019 after President Museveni broke ground for the project. The road which connects Masaka to Bukakkata and Kalangala Islands is only 5% complete after five months of work. According to the project manager Mr. Alfred Tugume, construction works cannot advance as anticipated due to unavailable funds and the risk of heavy rainfall. However, Mr. Tugume said they are working to see the project completed on time. Works on the road include clearing shoulders, removal of the existing top surface, compacting, cover with gravel and tarmac. The contractor is expected to complete the work in 24 months. “We are behind schedule but we are hopeful that we will be able to complete the project on record time and hand it over to the government,” said Mr. Tugume.

Once complete the road will help boost the tourism and farming sectors which are the major economic activities in the area. On the other side, Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) land valuer Mr. Moses Kintu has cautioned local residents against making false claims on compensation which have already been completed.
