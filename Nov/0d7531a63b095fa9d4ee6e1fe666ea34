Construction of the Commonwealth Hall Annex project at the University of Ghana is set to commence following a ground breaking ceremony performed by the Old Vandals Association, Alumni of the Commonwealth Hall of the university to mark the beginning of the project. Speaking during the ground breaking ceremony, Professor Ebenezer Oduro Owusu, the Vice-Chancellor of UG, said the project marked a critical step in the University’s effort to expand student accommodation on campus, and add unto their infrastructural stock. “This project comes at a time that the Junior Common Room of Commonwealth Hall has petitioned the high office of the Republic of Ghana to address the accommodation crises on campus. On this score, I am sure the junior members of Commonwealth Hall are happy to witness this event and will revise their notes especially with respect to their expectations from management,” said Professor Ebenezer.
