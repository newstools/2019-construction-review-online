The federal government of Nigeria has assured Lagosians of speedy completion of the rehabilitation works on the Apongbon Bridge. While making the announcement, the Federal Controller of Works, in Lagos, Engr. Adaramola Kuti also revealed that works had already started at the Apongbon end. Mr. Kuti, the Lagos State governor’s Special Adviser, Works and Infrastructure, Engr. Aramide Adeyoye and the state’s Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Fredrick Oladeinde, all assured Lagosians that the rehabilitation works on the bridge would end on December 14, 2019 with minimal effect on traffic. The Lagos State Controller of Works allayed the fear of residents that the Eko Bridge would be shut down as a result of the on-going rehabilitation work, noting that the rehabilitation work was meant to replace the flexible pavement of about 150m failed portion with rigid pavement to put the incessant failure of the portions to an end. While allaying fears that the bridge would be permanently shut during rehabilitation, Mr. Kuti explained that the portion was divided into two and would be worked upon alternately.

He revealed that all the expansion joints on the Durmerlong Bridge had been replaced and the bridge pavement resurfaced without shutting it down. The federal controller of works said he equally had no plans to shut down the 3rd Mainland bridge for rehabilitation before the end of this year, and assured that the bridge was very strong and safe. On the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Mr. Kuti disclosed that the construction works on the Kara to Berger portion of the road would be completed and that the entire bridge would be reopened to traffic on December 15 this year.
