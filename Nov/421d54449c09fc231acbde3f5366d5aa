Total cost of the projects is estimated to be US $1.12bn. Nareva Holding – Enel Green Power consortium, associated with Siemens Gamesa Renewables, won the international call for tenders in 2016 for the development, design, financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of the 850 MW Integrated Wind Energy Project and construction work set to begin in 2021. Upon completion, the 850 MW Integrated Wind Energy Project will save Morocco approximately 2,380,000 tons CO2/year, equivalent to the consumption of a city the size of Casablanca, the statement concluded. The national strategic objective is to improve security of supply by reducing dependence on energy imports, including increasing use of renewable sources for electricity production. By 2030, the country targets the green energy sector to to exceed 52% in the energy mix. In 2018, 1,212 MW of wind power, 1,770 MW of hydropower and 700 MW of solar capacity were installed across the country.
