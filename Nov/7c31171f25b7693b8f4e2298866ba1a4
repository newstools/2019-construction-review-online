Construction of the Lagos-Ibadan railway is set to be completed in April 2020. Nigeria’s Minister for Transportation, Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, made the revelation shortly after inspecting the project site in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. He also confirmed that test-running of the train would commence by the end of November 2019. Amaechi reiterated that, at the pace at which the contractors are currently working, he was optimistic that the completion period would be achieved. The minister said that the contractor had assured them that by December 20th this year, the laying of tracks would have gotten to Ibadan. This means that the focus will no longer be on the tracks but on the completion of the stations, communication and Signal operations, and once all this is achieved, they will be out of Ibadan. “They are eager to complete the stations but the constraint at the moment is that the equipment have not arrived from China, and our argument is that they should get some things from Nigeria. They are expecting pipes and other things, and they requested that we should give them one or two months to complete the stations,” he said.

The minister noted that the completion of the Lagos-end of the project was a huge task as construction of new flyovers and overhead bridges were progressing steadily. Amaechi also emphasized that safety of the people around rail lines must be put into consideration at all times. He, therefore instructed that buildings close to the rail line be bought off, demolished and fenced out to create adequate space for the railway line, and to also protect the people living around there.
