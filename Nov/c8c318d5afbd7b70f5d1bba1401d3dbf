Egypt is set to develop the 200MW Kom Ombo PV plant after it signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Saudi Arabian energy company ACWA Power to develop, finance, construct and operate the plant. Once operational, the plant will cater to the power needs of 130 thousand households, in addition to offsetting 280 thousand tons of carbon dioxide per year. According to Dr Mohamed Shaker, the Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Renewable Energy, the signing is a crucial building block that contributes to the Egyptian government’s vision, which aims to upscale sustainable energy security by moulding a balanced energy mix. “In reflection of HH Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the overall government’s ambitious vision, we are keen to leverage renewable energy sources through transparent competitive procurement, which will cater to the country’s current clean energy needs while simultaneously safeguarding our future,” he said. “The lowest tariff contracted to date for a solar energy in North Africa is not only a reflection of continuing improvement in technology and the entrepreneurship of the developer ACWA Power, but also of the attractiveness of Egypt as an investment destination and the trade and commercial environment of Egypt to enable facilities of this nature to be financed, constructed and operated efficiently,” Dr Shaker added.

Construction is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2021.
