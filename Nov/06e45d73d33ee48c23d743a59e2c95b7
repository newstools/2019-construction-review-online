Imo state government in Nigeria has awarded over US $110m contracts for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of dilapidated roads in the state, especially the major roads that link the state capital to other zones. Imo state Governor Emeka Ihedioha said that 25 road contracts had been awarded and 15% mobilisation fee paid to the contractors as they have satisfied the state’s requirements for the Advance Payment Guarantee (APG). The governor also ordered the successful contractors to mount sign boards indicating their names and addresses for public awareness, adding that his intention was to establish good governance through the Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP). The governor explained that the commission of inquiry put in place by his administration on contract review and forceful acquisition of lands by the immediate past administration in the state was in response to deluge of petitions by aggrieved individuals.
