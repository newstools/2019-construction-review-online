The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, also affirmed that Nigerian roads are not as bad as they are being portrayed. He insisted that reports on the poor state of roads in the country are mere hype. He further explained that but for funding challenges, most road projects would have been long completed. Nigeria has the largest road network in West Africa and the second largest south of the Sahara, with roughly 108,000 km of surfaced roads in 1990. Total road network includes motorways, highways, and main or national roads. However they are poorly maintained and are often cited as a cause for the country’s high rate of road fatalities.
