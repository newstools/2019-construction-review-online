Kenya is set to construct an office block worth US $3.4m in Meru county for Meru MCAs.  Assembly speaker Joseph Kaberia made the announcement and said that the building’s aim is to decongest the current offices. “The MCAs currently occupy former offices and debating chambers used by the defunct Meru County Council and they are fully packed thus we need a bigger vacinity. It will not only save the assembly a lot of money in rent, but ensure MCAs have a conducive working environment,” said Speaker Joseph Kaberia.

It will be fitted with two lifts and will boast of an underground parking lot and a cafeteria. The building project which is in line with the Commission on Revenue Allocations recommendations, will accommodate the 69 MCAs, nominated MCAs who have offices in different areas in the county, the Speaker, and other county staff. Construction of the building will start this year and will be implemented in phases. The block’s design was done by county staff at no cost and is projected to be completed in three years time because funds that are currently available are not adequate. Additionally, the county government was procuring land to build a US $344,000 speaker’s official residence. Kaberia explained that the National Land Commission had not provided the county with a space to build the official residence and that is why it was being forced to purchase it.
