Construction of the tallest residential modular building in the world, situated at 101 George Street in Croydon, a large town in south London, England, is set to be fully completed by the fifth month of next year. Featuring 1,526 modules, the building stands at a height of 135.6m making it the tallest modular apartment tower in the world, followed closely by the Clement Canopy Towers in Singapore at 130m high. The 44- and 38-story-towered scheme, developed by Henderson Park and Greystar will have 546 ‘build to rent’ homes.
