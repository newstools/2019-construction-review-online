The country’s stations sent out a total of 1 505, 44GWh of energy, thereby missing the quarterly target which was set at 2,355,61 GWh by 39,09%. “This output is 67,48% below the output for the same period in 2018. For the year to date, ZPC has managed to send out 6219,28 GWh and this represents a negative variance of 9,08%.” said the firm. ZPC attributed the lower power generation levels to breakdowns experienced at Hwange Unit 6 and low water levels at Kariba.
