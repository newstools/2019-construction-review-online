The government of Mozambique has inaugurated the Vanduzi water project in the country to ensure that the public has access to clean drinking water in order to prevent the spread of water-borne diseases. The Vanduzi water plant contains a water treatment centre, an elevated water deposit, and a distribution network that is 23,500m long. Initially the system had 50 domestic connections and two public standpipes. When the system is expanded it could supply water to over 50,000 people. Execution of the US $1.7m project began in December 2018 and was fully financed by the British government, as part of the National Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programme (PRONASAR). In its first phase, the project will benefit about 12,500 residents in six neighbourhoods of Vanduzi town.

With the new system, the President said, the water production capacity in Vanduzi will rise to 566 cubic metres a day. This means that the clean water coverage rate in the district will rise from 49.6 to 54.2% of the population. “As you can see, we still have a lot to do, but we are doing it gradually,” said Nyusi. Manica province possesses 2,155 water sources (wells and boreholes), of which 1,985 are operational. It also has 71 operational water supply systems: those in the Tambara, Macossa, Mossurize and Guro district capitals are being rehabilitated, which will benefit about 100,000 people.
