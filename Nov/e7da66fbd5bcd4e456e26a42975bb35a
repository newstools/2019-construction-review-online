The government of Ghana has approved six months extension request from the contractor working on the US $84m four-tier Pokuase Interchange in the Ga West Municipality of the Greater Accra. This means that the project would be completed towards the end of next year, instead of April 2020, the original scheduled date of completion. Mr Kwabena Bempong, Associate Vice President of Associated Consultants Limited, a consulting company for the project, made the disclosure in Accra during a tour of the project site. He further added that the contractor organized additional shifts and was convinced the project would be completed on schedule. Currently, the project is 50% complete; the town roads, 6km of adjoin roads from Awoshie to Kwabenya stretch had been asphalted. Streets lights, pedestrian walkways, traffic lights have also been completed; and the piles (foundations for the road) and piers (columns which would carry the overhead roads) are nearing completion. Mr Bempong said the contractor had almost completed the storm drains and embankment along both sides of the Awoshie and Accra-Nsawam stretch to prevent flooding and landslides on the road.
