The government of Tanzania is seeking funds from the African Development Bank (AfDB) to upgrade the Morogoro-Dodoma road. Finance and Planning Minister Dr Phillip Mpango revealed the report and said that the road project aims to improve road transport between the capital city and central transport corridor. “This road was constructed long time ago. Trucks that travel to Mwanza and Kigoma regions as well as to neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi pass here, in Dodoma. You can clearly see the road has started to wear out,”said Dr Mpango.

Traffic volumes on the existing Dar es Salaam – Morogoro road currently exceed the road’s
design capacity, resulting in severe congestion. The associated long travel times and road
safety issues further hamper socio-economic development in the region. The upgrade works on the over 270-kilometre stretch road involves transforming it to a four-lane highway between Dar es Salaam and Morogoro, which is part of a much larger Central Corridor project between Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), Kigali (Rwanda), Bujumbura (Burundi) and Kampala (Uganda), as well as a number of bridges. Rehabilitation and upgrading of the road upon completion will be the first toll road in Tanzania (First 100 km 6 lanes and then 4 lanes). The project requires the construction of a new road, adjacent to the existing road, that will give drivers the choice between paying for a superior toll road, constructed to expressway standards, or making use of the existing road.
