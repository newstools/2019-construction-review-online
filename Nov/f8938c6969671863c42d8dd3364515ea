Geothermal Development Company (GDC), the Kenyan public company that is developing the Baringo-Silali geothermal project in the Rift Valley, has obtained a new grant from the Geothermal Risk Mitigation Facility (GRMF). According to GDC the geothermal project is progressing well and the US $18.6m grant is intended to allow geothermal exploration to continue under the project by enabling new drilling. In practical terms, the company’s expenses will be reimbursed each time it completes a geothermal well. This is the second time that GRMF has awarded a grant to GDC for its Baringo-Silali geothermal project. In March 2019, GRMF had already allocated a grant of US $13m to it. This funding has enabled the company to make progress on its project.

The first well was drilled at Paka, which is one of the three sites of the Baringo-Silali geothermal project. A total of six geothermal wells will be drilled in Paka, Salini and Korosi. GDC expects that each site of the Baringo-Silali geothermal project will have a power plant that will use the steam emitted from the subsoil heat to run its turbines, providing 100MW. The three sites will therefore supply a total of 300MW. Experts estimate that the Baringo-Silali geothermal site can produce up to 3,000 MW. Created by the African Union (AU) Commission, GRMF is a sub-regional organisation that finances and facilitates the development of geothermal energy in East Africa.  “The allocation of funds is a sign of confidence in the GDC and also in geothermal energy as an energy of the present and the future,” says Johnson Ole Nchoe, GDC’s Executive Director.
