The Federal Government of Nigeria has inaugurated two million cubic metres water plants in Malete, Moro Local Government Area of Kwara State. The Minister of Water Resources, Alhaji Suleiman Adamu, who inaugurated the project, alongside the Managing Director of LNRBDA, Dr Adeniyi Saheed Aremu, said the government was committed to the provision of clean water to the people. “The government is making effort to ensure water sanitation which is a fundamental human right. This is also one of the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG),” said Suleiman Adamu.

The project development was awarded Turning Point Engineering Limited in 2013. They were tasked with construction of a new dam of about 8.2 metres high, 400metres and a treatment plant. “The former water plant has a capacity for 22.5 cubic metres per hour (225,000 litres per hour) while the new one, which will complement the existing one, has a capacity of 50,000 litres per hour,’’ said Managing Director, Turning Point Engineering Limited, Mr Kayode Sangoyomi. Access to clean water and improved sanitation facilities is a daily challenge for many Nigerians. This problem is particularly acute in northern Nigeria, where only 30% of the population has access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation. This contributes to high prevalence of waterborne diseases, threatens the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, and contributes to low levels of school enrollment, especially among girls. Through partnerships with local governments and the private sector, USAID is increasing access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene education among some of the most at-risk communities in the north.
