The City Administration of Addis Ababa is set to inaugurate the renovated Abebe Bikila Memorial Stadium early next month. The US $3.5m renovation works are 96% complete, with only the installation of flood lights and cladding remaining. Installation of cladding is expected to be done in 10 days time while the floodlights will take two weeks since they are being imported. The key renovations work done to the Stadium includes: importing and assembling 16,000 spectator seats, installing sheds, building a running track and maintaining the football field. “The Stadium will give an additional beauty to the capital,” said Fekadu Alemu, sports project coordinator of the Addis Abeba City Construction Bureau.

The firm won the international bid announced in August 2016 by the Public Procurement & Property Disposal Service after making the lowest bid to renovate the multi-purpose stadium. Zhongmie has previously worked on the construction of the Afar Highroad Project and subcontracted grouting work on the Megach Dam project. The design of the Stadium was first awarded to Ultimate Consulting, a local consultancy, but due to disagreements with the City Administration over the design proposal, its contract was terminated in February 2018. The Bureau took over design and consultancy services after that. Once operational, the Stadium will rent out 63 commercial spaces located nearby to youth interested in working in the recreational industry. Additionally, the city is also planning to construct five brand new stadiums in the districts of Yeka, Nifas Silk Lafto, Bole, Gulele and Aqaqi Qality.
