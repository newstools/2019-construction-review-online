A photovoltaic solar power plant that was built by Cap Sud Madagascar, a subsidiary of the French company Cap Sud, is now operational near the city of Ilakaka in Madagascar. The plant was built 1km from the city of Ilakaka that is located in the southern part of Madagascar, which has developed through an open-pit mine of precious stones, including sapphire. The mini solar power plant has a capacity of 460kWp and consists of 1,415 solar panels connected to inverters. The facility is also equipped with a battery storage system installed in two re-equipped and equipped containers. The purpose of the system is to allow the plant to provide electricity after sunset. The batteries are thus capable of storing 1500 kWh. Electricity generated from this plant will be sold to the Water and Electricity Company of Madagascar. It is intended for households and small businesses located in the village of Andohan’Ilakaka.

This is a real technological and economic transformation that will make it possible to fight against pollution but also against the increase in the price of diesel and therefore of energy on the big island,” a statement from Cap Sud read. This is not the first solar project that Cap Sud Madagascar has undertaken in the country. It has built a 410 kWp hybrid mini solar power plant within the Galaxy Andraharo area. The plant supplies electricity to four buildings housing the offices of several companies, including the subsidiaries of the Axian group, which invests particularly in the energy sector.
