According to the Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, the road and the bridge would link Kwara and Niger states to facilitate movement between South-west and North-central. “FEC approves the contract for the construction of Bida-Sachi-Nupeko road and the Nupeko-Patigi Bridge across River Niger, linking Nupeko and Patigi in Niger and Kwara State. The project is to link Niger and kwara together and facilitate connectivity from South-west to the north central and the north of Nigeria,” he said. He further added that, the project, which was first awarded in 2013 without the bridge, but was later terminated for non-performance, and revaluated; would be completed in 30 months.

He insisted that reports on the poor state of roads in the country are mere hype. He further explained that but for funding challenges, most road projects would have been long completed. Nigeria has the largest road network in West Africa and the second largest south of the Sahara, with roughly 108,000 km of surfaced roads in 1990. Total road network includes motorways, highways, and main or national roads. However they are poorly maintained and are often cited as a cause for the country’s high rate of road fatalities.
