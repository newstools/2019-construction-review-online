Nigeria’s Oyo State Government has revoked the initially awarded US $19m contract or the reconstruction of Moniya-Iseyin road and rewarded it US $27m. The State Commissioner for Works and Transport, Raphael Afonja made the announcement and said that the initial contract which was awarded by the immediate past administration of Abiola Ajimobi was terminated by Governor Seyi Makinde due to inconsistencies and under-performance of the contractor engaged by the Ajimobi administration.

Mr. Raphael Afonja explained that the increase in the contract sum was because they had reviewed the design to ensure quality. “We made some changes in the design; we increased the stubbing course from about 150mm to about 200mm, and we also changed the asphaltic wearing course from 40mm to 50mm. We also realised that there was inadequate provision for drainage system for that road in the initial design; we have changed that to ensure adequate drainage,” said Raphael Afonja. The commissioner  added that fluctuations in terms of the price of materials were considered, adding that the projection that the road would last for a minimum of 10 years was also factored in. The popular Moniya-Iseyin road, upon completion will ease the difficulties experienced by motorists along the road which has become increasingly impassable by the day due to its near collapse.
