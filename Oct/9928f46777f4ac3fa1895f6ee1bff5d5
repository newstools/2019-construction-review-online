Construction of a 13 MW solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant meant to provide electricity for Nordgold’s Bissa and Bouly mines in Burkina Faso, is expected to begin soon. This is after an agreement was signed between Nordgold, a UK based worldwide gold miner and Total Eren, a renewable energy independent power producer. The latter will be working on the project with its strategic development partner known as the Africa Energy Management Platform (AEMP). As per the agreement, both Total Eren and AEMP are expected to develop, finance, build and operate the PV power plant, which will also have a battery energy storage system. The implementation of the project is estimated to be finalized by the end of next year. Upon completion, the project is expected to produce sufficient electricity that will meet both mines’ daily operational needs, in that way reducing significantly, the reliance on the existing thermal power plant. The new solar PV plant is also expected to reduce the mines’ fuel consumption by about 6.4-million liters and carbon dioxide emissions by about 18 000 t/y. Other than improving environmental sustainability, the PV solar power plant will also increase the security of supply and reduce costs at both mines.
