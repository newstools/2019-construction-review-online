South Africa’s Municipal Planning Tribunal has approved the Harbour Arch development project set to cost US $956m and be largest mixed-use development of its kind in the Cape Town CBD. The parcel of Foreshore land, spanning 5.3 hectares, was previously owned by Transnet, but has since been bought by Amdec for its mixed-use development. The rezoning application for the development was approved in August 2012. Amdec, however, then applied to amend the conditions of approval in December 2018. This was to account for a change in lease ownership and to adjust the size of the development to include residential units.

The development project will be home to six individual tower blocks with a total 200 000m² of usable space, making it the first and largest mixed-use development of its kind in the Cape Town CBD. It will offer sought-after new urban living, ideal for working professionals, first-time buyers, investors, students and corporate long-stay accommodation. The mixed use property will be built on sustainable principles and eco-friendly innovation. Integrated green building initiatives will include refuse recycling, water-saving devices and rainwater harvesting, a centralised district cooling facility and low-energy LED lighting. It will also house restaurants, cocktail bars, shopping, hotels, banking, medical services, and health clubs. The development has been strategically located at the confluence of the N1 and N2 highways making it highly visible to anyone arriving in the city. This unrivalled location will also provide quick and easy vehicular access to the airport, the southern suburbs, the northern suburbs, the Atlantic seaboard and the winelands.
