The construction of world’s largest offshore wind farm located in the east coast of Britain, approximately 120km off England’s Yorkshire coast is nearly complete. The wind farm, which goes by the name of Hornsea One, upon completion in early 2020, will produce enough energy to supply 1 million UK homes with clean electricity for over 3 decades.

It consists of 174 seven-megawatt wind turbines that are 100m tall each. The blades have a circumference of 75m, and cover an area larger than Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel (London Eye) as they turn. According to Stefan Hoonings, the senior project manager at Orsted (DOGEF), the Danish energy company that is building the farm, one of these turbines can power the average home in the UK for an entire day with only a single rotation. The Hornsea One project will take the United Kingdom closer to hitting its target of deriving a third, 33% to be precise, of the country’s electricity from offshore wind only, by the year 2030. Three more phases of the Hornsea project are on the cards. Currently the United Kingdom receives 33% of electricity from renewable sources of energy; mostly onshore wind. Along with nuclear, low-carbon electricity makes up 52% of Britain’s total and only 5% comes from coal.
