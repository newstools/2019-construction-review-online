The Government of Kenya has announced plans for the construction of a US $270m mega city. Draft plans for the “Railway City” that will see the expansion of Nairobi’s Central Business District (CBD) have already been released thus paving way for project implementation. Dubbed the Railway City Masterplan, the 425-acre project is expected to be completed in the next 20 years in three phases. Aside from the main station area, it will also contain a residential area and business hubs. Railway infrastructure will gobble a huge chunk of the project at US $169m followed by water supply and construction of roads and pavements that will take US $38m and US $19m respectively. The draft plans describe it as a “multi-modal” hub in the CBD that will guarantee “seamless connection” among commuter rail, three Bus Rapid Transits, airport limousine city bus and non-motorised transport such as bicycles.

Other facilities will include residential buildings, community and government buildings, open space and plazas, and powerful non-motorized and pedestrian walkways. “Such a diverse urban programme will generate a 24-hour dynamic city,” added the PS. The project expects to ease congestion on Uhuru Highway, Haile Selassie Avenue and Landhies Road. Kenyans will be expected to give their views on the project in the next sixty days before the plans are finalised.
