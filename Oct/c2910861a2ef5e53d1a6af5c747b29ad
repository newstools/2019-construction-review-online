The largest mosque in West Africa has officially opened its doors. Sufi Mouride Brotherhood inaugurated the US $33m building located in Dakar, Senegal in the presence of President Macky Sall and his predecessor Abdoulaye Wade. Construction on the mosque dubbed the ‘Massalikul Jinaan mosque’ which means “the Paths to Paradise”, began a decade ago. The name was derived from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, who is revered by followers as a Sufi saint. Based in the city of Touba, the movement is a pillar of Senegal’s reputation for religious tolerance.
