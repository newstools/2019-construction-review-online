The government of Togo has unveiled plans to install off-grid solar power panels in 14 villages in the country. They villages are located in the central regions, Kara and the savannah, among others. According to Patrice Kwamé, the Executive Secretary of the Council of the Entente, the organisation’s commitment to developing the off grid electricity is reflected here Togo. “We are continuing its development in this country and in the other member states of the organisation,”  he said. The Council of the Entente is a West African regional economic cooperation organisation. It includes several countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Niger. A few months earlier, this institution financed the distribution of solar kits to 350 households in rural Togo. The project was implemented by the Togolese Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Agency. It also conducted a series of actions that could enable Togo achieve its ambition to increase from the current rural electrification rate of 8% to 50% in 2030.

The assessment produced in July 2019 established that this initiative had made it possible to equip more than 23,000 households with solar kits. The programme also enabled the Electricity Company of Togo (CEET) to build 65,000 social connections. Through the Cizo project, the government plans to implement at least 300,000 solar systems across the country.
