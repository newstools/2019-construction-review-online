Rehabilitation works on the Sunyani Airport in Ghana are almost complete. President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo made the announcement and said that the airport will be reopened by end of this year. Sunyani Airport is an airport serving Sunyani, a town and capital of Brong Ahafo mid-western Ghana. The airport dates back in 1942, when a communication outpost and aerodrome was built for the use of the Allied Forces. However, before the end of the war, the airport was abandoned. Rehabilitation works on the airport involves the runway receiving a facelift and the main hall partitioned. Some of the offices within the airport will also be relocated. Project contractor, DAA Construction built a fence wall around the airport while Resources Access Limited (RAL) are handling resurfacing and extension of the runway as well as separation of the departure hall from the arrival hall.

Additionally, 10km of Sunyani town roads would be asphalted by the end of March next year while several roads in the region have been awarded on contract. More than US $9m is being spent on the development. “Rehabilitation of the worn-out bitumen and cracks on the runway was critical since the current state of the runway was not good for landing and taking off. The current length of 1.4km runway needed an additional 500 or 600 metres to make it a standard airport for aircraft to land and take off. Engineers will consider whether to fill up the valleys or constrict overheads to get the required length,” said Mr Addah.
