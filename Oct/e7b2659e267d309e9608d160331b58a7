Polyflor SA demonstrated their commitment to ensuring ongoing sustainability in the healthcare industry during a recent exhibit at the biennial SAFHE/CEASA conference held at the CTICC. Widely acclaimed as the flagship event for healthcare infrastructure in Southern Africa, this year’s event brought together delegates from both the public and private healthcare sectors to explore the challenges, complexities and opportunities for improving healthcare services in Southern Africa. “Exhibiting at the SAFHE / CEASA conference offers us the opportunity to engage with the decision makers in the healthcare industry and to position our expertise in the market,” says Tandy Coleman, CEO of Polyflor SA.The company showcased some of its popular products and solutions for the healthcare industry on its 36 m² sized stand. Many of these products have already been installed and used with great success at recent hospital refurbishments, such as the Ngwelezane Hospital in KZN, and Mmametlhake Hospital Bethalhospitals. “Polyflor prides itself on not just being a flooring supplier we also communicated our ongoing commitment to a project, our clients and the environment. Our vinyl flooring has a low environmental impact and is known as one of the most environmentally friendly options. Additionally, we were able to explain our “cradle to grave” approach as well as educate visitors about our exciting project that recycles vinyl floor off-cuts. The feedback we received from the many visitors who came to engage with us, was that they were very impressed with our service offering and are excited about the future of the healthcare industry in South Africa,” Tandy concludes.
