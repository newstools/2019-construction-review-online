Additionally, the company is also developing a US $9.3m A1 jet fuel handling and storage facility at the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare. The development of the project comes at a time when the government is pressing ahead with ethanol blending to cut the cost of petroleum imports amid foreign currency shortages. In June 2018, the government increased the mandatory blending ratio of unleaded petrol from 15% ethanol to 20% with immediate effect following significant improvements in the supply of ethanol from Green Fuel. The increase of ethanol blending thresholds has increasingly become important for the country given growing demand for petrol, which is imported, at a time foreign currency needed for the imports is in critical short supply.
