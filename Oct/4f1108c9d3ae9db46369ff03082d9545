The Laikipia county boss said that they have committed themselves as a government to be useful to investors by adding value to the investment processes to the fulfillment of those who seek to establish businesses in Laikipia. “We are very pleased to work with the County government of Laikipia on this project following their devotion to providing an investment-friendly framework,” said Ms. Dodhia. Governor Muriithi expounded on the importance of the project to the region saying that it would provide clean energy as the country steers to move away from thermal energy plants that mainly rely on diesel-powered engines that are not only hazardous but also expensive to run, consequently making power costs to shoot. During construction, the project is expected to provide 100 direct jobs to local residents and once complete an additional 20 people will be permanently employed to operate the facility. The project is being developed under the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum Feed-in Tariff Regime. The Kenergy Renewables Company has entered into a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with Kenya Power to supply the electricity generated.
