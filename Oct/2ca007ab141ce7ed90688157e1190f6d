Chinese financial institutions have suspended the funding of three big infrastructural projects totalling US$1.324bn after the government of Zimbabwe raided and diverted US $10m from an escrow account for the Robert Mugabe International Airport expansion project. The affected infrastructural projects include the US $1.1bn Hwange 7 and 8 refurbishment project, the US $71m NetOne expansion project and US $153m Robert Mugabe International Airport expansion; which are at various stages of implementation. They were being funded through various loan facilities secured from the China Eximbank and other financial institutions. The seized funds, which were converted by government, through the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) into the local unit, were raided from an account holding investment capital for the expansion of the airport at the beginning of the year where the airport project was being undertaken by Jiangsu International and getting funds through a concessional loan facility from Once the airport is operational, the project will transform it into a modern facility, which will increase its capacity from handling two million travellers to about six million annually.
