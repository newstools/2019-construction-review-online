Kenya has officially opened Mama Ngina Waterfront Park that was redeveloped at US $4.6m. The seaside public park was reopened to the public on Sunday 20th October for the Mashujaa Day fete. The 26-acre park that overlooks the Kilindini Channel in Mombasa County has been transformed into an integrated urban tourist attraction site. The refurbishment included landscaping and paving the waterfront with concrete blocks, construction of an amphitheatre, the Kilindini Cultural Centre, ablution blocks and two main gates. Tourists visiting the park will attend cultural exhibitions, shop, dine at open-air fresco restaurants and cafes or relax at the expansive site. The project is designed to support a 24-hour economy and its layout includes a new jetty for water taxis.

President Uhuru Kenyatta commissioned construction of the park in January, saying he expected it to restore the glory of Mombasa as a top tourist destination in the region. The redevelopment that was undertaken by a local company, Suhufi Agencies, was completed in time for the Mashujaa Day fete. The celebrations took place in Mombasa County as part of the counties’ rotational hosting of national events.
