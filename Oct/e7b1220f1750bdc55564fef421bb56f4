Road users and inhabitants of this region look forward to congestion relief as a result of this upgrade through an additional carriageway in both the southerly and northerly direction on Broadway Boulevard between Beach Road and the De Beers/N2 interchange as well as upgraded intersections. Universal accessibility will also be enhanced by non-motorized transport facilities for cyclists and two pedestrian bridges adjacent to the existing road bridge over the N2. As of now, work completed on the Kommetjie Road includes reconstruction of Frigate Crescent and the Palm Avenue/Kommetjie Main Road intersection, road widening and stabilizing gravel layer on the southbound carriageway of Ou Kaapse Weg from Noordhoek Main Road to the four-way-stop and on Noordhoek Main Road from Houmoed Ave to Montrose Cose. About 2600 tons of bitumen has also been laid on the eastbound carriageway of Kommetjie Main Road from Living Hope towards the four-way stop and the eastbound lane of Noordhoek Main Road from Montrose to the signalized intersection. Purchase thanked all residents and motorists for their patience during the construction period and assured them that they will benefit from the project in a few months’ time.
