A US $3.8m rice research institute is set to be constructed in Busia County, Western Part of Kenya to boost production and marketing of the crop in the region. The project which will be the first of its kind in the country will be funded by the Venezuela government. According to Jane Ndung’u the head of the Rice Promotion Programme in the Ministry of Agriculture, the Busia project will improve innovation and research. “The institute will develop new products for the lowland areas and also quality grains that are tolerant to diseases and harsh weather conditions,” she said. “Rice is one of the main food crops that the national government has included in the Big Four Agenda under Food security pillar, and because of that we want to start with boosting the uptake of rice from Busia through the construction of the institute,” added Ms. Ndung’u.
