Expansion works of the Prestea Government Hospital in Ghana is set to begin after the Member of Parliament (MP) for Prestea Huni-Valley Constituency, Mrs Barbara Oteng- Gyasi cut the sod for the development. Mrs Oteng-Gyasi explained that the expansion and redeveloping have become necessary because the facilities at the hospital could no longer serve the number of people in Prestea and its environs.
