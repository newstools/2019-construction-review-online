Settling sludge and faecal sludge will also be recovered. The two facilities will be managed by Sewerage Systems Ghana (SSGL), a subsidiary of JGC is expected toÂ create about 1,000 direct and indirect jobs in each city where fecal waste treatment facilities are currently nonexistent. In Ghana, urban and rural sanitation infrastructure is poor. Only a small portion of the wastewater from the urban cities (mostly domestic) is collected for treatment. The bulk ends up in drains and nearby water bodies. Conventional treatment plants are underutilized due to poor sewage network in the cities where they are located. Any significant improvement in the network will mean demolition of several buildings to make way for pipe network construction. The rural areas have no means of treating the wastewater produced. Small scale or decentralized systems of wastewater treatment is seen as an alternative to solving these problems both in the big cities and small villages in the country.
