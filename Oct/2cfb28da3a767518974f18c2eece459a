Considering that this one is going to be bigger, it requires a lot of preparation in the form of putting in place some specific infrastructure. That is the budget for construction of roads and junctions alone. However, more money is expected to be spent on street lighting and painting,” said Pudence Rubingisa, the City Mayor. The road projects expected to be completed by the end April 2020. In addition to the upgrades, the mayor said, the city is working on improving the quality of service delivery in the hospitality industry to cater for the high number of delegates that is expected. The CHOGM 2020 will be held at the Kigali Convention Centre during the week starting June 22, around the theme ‘Delivering A Common Future: Connecting, Innovating, Transforming’. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rwanda is preparing to receive up to 10,000 guests during the meeting.
