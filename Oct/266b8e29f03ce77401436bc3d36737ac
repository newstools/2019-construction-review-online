Kenya has commenced construction of an ultra-modern stadium in Mombasa. Mombasa County sports executive Munywoki Kyalo revealed the reports and said the field will be used for hosting local, national and international matches. The move is also aimed at addressing the shortage of sporting activities, caused by lack of adequate stadia. The Mombasa County Stadium, estimated to cost US $16m was scheduled for construction in 2018 but experienced delays because the county sports council wanted to include facilities for other sports and not just football.
