Feasibility studies for the construction of the Jumuiya market in Busia, Kenya, are expected to kick off in the second month of next year. This was revealed by Simon Konzolo, an official at the Trade Mark East Africa (TMEA). The US $1bn project will be enabled by the Ministry of East African Community (EAC) in collaboration with the Trade Mark East Africa (TMEA). Konzolo stated that they had a misunderstanding with the initial consultant over the cost of the project and the entire plan, and this forced them to go back to the drawing board. According to Konzolo the actual construction of the market will start as soon as the assessment of the practicality of the project is over. “The instant the project is proved viable we will embark on the design and subsequently the construction of the market,” he said adding that currently his team is holding talks with stakeholders in the region to find out the most suitable means to carry out the project.

He, however, mentioned that based on past experiences, this is not a project that will be done within a short period of time. Upon completion, the market is set to serve Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan.
