The ultra-modern office complex will serve as the main administrative block to accommodate the entire staff of the Ghana Armed Forces, upon completion. The complex will contain 37 offices, three conference rooms and an Armoury and a kitchen. The Vice-President urged the GAF hierarchy to proceed with the construction of the main structure in earnest and assured them of the government’s support. He expressed the hope that the Army would adhere strictly to the maintenance of the building to ensure a desired working environment and the promotion of staff efficiency and work satisfaction. “As we are aware, the Army Headquarters serves as the nerve centre for such critical internal security and major operations. To this end, a befitting facility such as this is ideal for the planning and coordination of activities. The new project should, therefore, usher in new hope for the entire workforce of the Army,” said Dr Bawumia. “The Government on its part will  also do all within its means to ensure that you get the necessary training and logistics to carry out your counter terrorism operations,” he added.
