The government of Kenya has suspended construction of the US $3bn Nairobi-Mombasa expressway project for two years. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia revealed the report and said the suspension is due to the country’s debt concerns. “We have decided to suspend the project for at least two years to allow the country’s debt levels to drop, while also prioritizing other key projects,” CS James Macharia.

The project according to design maps of the high-speed road, will bypass the capital city to branch off just past Konza and terminate onto the Nakuru highway in Kikuyu. According to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) Director General Peter Mundinia, the road will have  four lanes capable of supporting sustained speeds of up to 120 kilometers per hour and is expected to reduce travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi from the current 10 to four hours. Bechtel, a US-based private construction conglomerate, won the contract in a government-to-government deal that formed part of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s discussions with President Donald Trump during his US visit last year.
