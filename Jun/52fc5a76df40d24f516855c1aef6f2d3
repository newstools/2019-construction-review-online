Constructed by a workforce of 5,000, the two-way highway has a width of 10m in rural areas and 21.5m in urban areas. The old Dire Dawa-Dewele road was a gravel road that disrupted transportation due to frequent damages caused by flood and landslide.  The road will connect Ethiopia with Djibouti, along the existing road from Dewele to Djibouti. The road has a 10cm thickness, crosses over 29 bridges and will have three toll plazas. The project was expected to be delivered last year, but the Authority extended the delivery date by one year, since the project was modified to make the road thicker. The project was constructed by China’s CGCOC Group and the consulting contract was given to Shandong Great Supervision and Consultation Co. Ltd, a Chinese road design and construction consultancy. About 85% of the construction was financed through loan obtained from China’s Exim Bank and the remaining sum by the Ethiopian government. CGCOC Group, the company previously constructed the Ethiopian Glass Factory and the Nile River Bridge Project and is currently working on the Addis-Africa International Exhibition & Convention Center Dagmawit Moges said that the government has also targeted 220,000Km in road coverage by the end of the second edition of the Growth & Transformation Plan (GTP II) in 2020.
