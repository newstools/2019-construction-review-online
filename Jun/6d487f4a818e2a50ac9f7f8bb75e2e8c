The government of Liberia has broken ground for the construction a 33KV power station with the aim of reducing transmission gaps in Sinkor, Congo Town and Paynesville City. Speaking at the groundbreaking European Union’s Charge d’Affaires Juan Antnio Frutos said that the new station is part of the ‘Light Up Monrovia program’ – the Monrovia Consolidation of electricity transmission and distribution project funded by the EU. “We understand the urgency and need for Liberians to get connected to the grid as soon as possible. Thousands of people in Monrovia waiting to get electricity can steadily see their communities being legally connected o the electricity grid one step at a time,” said Frutos.

The project includes a double circuit tension line with 40 MVA and the replacement of some damaged wooden poles. The power station upon completion is estimated to power 38,000 new homes and 2,100 street lights will also be installed. It will be a massive boost for Liberia’s energy sector as it will close the gap between the main transmission line connecting Bushorld Island and Paynesville stations. Additionally, the project will also involve the training of engineering students of the University of Liberia and Stella Maris Polythenic . About 40 students – gender balance of male and female – will work as interns and will be as they learn from with the foreign experts for the next six months. According to the Liberia Electricity Corporation, the Old Road station, which will be located next to the James Spings Airport, will give flexibility of the transmission of power, increase capacity of the two other stations and increase the capacity of power distribution.
