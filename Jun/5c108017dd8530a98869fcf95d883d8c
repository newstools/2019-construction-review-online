Kenya has signed US $42m deal with a Chinese healthcare delegation for construction of a hospital in Nyandarua County. This is in line with the Governor Francis Kimemia agenda of providing accessible health service sector that is preventive, curative, responsive, efficient and affordable. The agreement which was signed by Prof Li Zuo and Kidney Research Kenya, led by Dr. Macharia Gakuru, will see the construction of a 400 bed capacity hospital. The hospital is specifically set to provide renal health care for residents. “This agreement is a follow-up of the meeting we had in China last July in which we committed to invite potential investors to put up investments in our County’s health system,” said Governor Kimemia.

The current renal unit providing dialysis services was set up at the JM Kariuki hospital under the devolved County administration. The unit started offering hemodialysis services catering for patients from Laikipia, Nakuru and Nyandarua counties. The initial session had three patients, but has since increased to 22 patients. The involved parties will also explore a training program in renal services; standardization of renal treatment, diagnostics and procedures; alongside physical investments in health equipment and facilities. “Our intention is to create a holistic approach around renal services. We are interested in investing in knowledge, skills, physical equipment and facilities to meet the needs of the patients. That way, decision making for health can be informed by local data at the County level. I also urge the county government to invest in research and development in health, inclusive of renal diseases,” said Prof Zou.
