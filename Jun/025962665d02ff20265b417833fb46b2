The government expects the industrial park, when operational, will create direct and indirect job opportunities for close to 40,000 Ethiopians. Wang said construction of the project has already hired more than 7,000 locals. Aiming at becoming a middle-income industrialized nation by 2025, Ethiopia has built many industrial parks and industry Zones throughout the regions, to attract investment in various industries. Prior to the Dire Dawa project, CCECC also built Ethiopia’s Adama Industrial Park, which was recently inaugurated, and the country’s flagship Hawassa Industrial Park, which was considered by the Ethiopian government as “a model industrial park.” Ethiopia strives to be the hub of light manufacturing industries in Africa, placing an ambitious plan to develop world-class industrial parks with fascinating hard and soft infrastructure.
