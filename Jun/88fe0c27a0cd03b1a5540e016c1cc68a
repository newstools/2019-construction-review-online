Ghana has completed construction of two more footbridges on Madina-Adenta Highway, bringing to three the number of bridges completed and opened for use by the public. Minister of Roads and Highways, Mr Amoako-Atta announced the reports during his inspection visit on the remaining footbridges. He pointed out that footbridges at the Senior High (WASS), the Ritz junction and the Seven Day Adventist junction have been completed, while those at the Atomic junction, Â the Madina Zongo junction and the Redco Flats area are yet to be completed due to delays in relocation of utility facilities.

The spontaneous reaction from the residents compelled the government to award contracts to six different contractors to construct the bridges to save motorists and pedestrians from further agony. Mr Amoako-Atta expressed satisfaction on the work done adding that paving and landscaping would be done by contractors since the works were not part of the original contract. Morover, lights would also be installed along the entire stretch to ensure the safety of pedestrians. The Minister said that the remaining three footbridges were behind schedule and should be completed and opened to the public by the end of the month. He also urged the public to use the footbridge always when crossing the highway instead of putting their lives in danger considering that many pedestrians have lost their lives along the stretch.
