Liberia is set to construct a new modern market in Old Road community. The market is part of several projects that the president is undertaking to transform the lives of his people and also his continuation of the fulfillment of promises he made to ordinary Liberians, mainly marketers during the 2017 election campaign. “The design for the new Old-Road Community market structure is already available, and the construction works will soon get underway. The old market, which was constructed several years ago, is now in a deplorable state,” Said His Excellency. Duport Road Community is one of few communities that have already benefited from market buildings, which the President has promised to construct. The 14-Gobachop is another market being built which is is expected to contain distinct compartments for the sale of different food stuffs and other goods as well as car park. The President additionally toured the populous slum community of West Point where he assessed the erosion situation that has already displaced hundreds of residents and business people. Over the years, substantial portion of the West Point Township has been lost to vicious sea erosion, leaving hundreds of residents displaced and homes completely washed away. However, the government has made efforts to curb the situation through the ‘Coastal Defence project’, an initiative established to salvage salvaged some of the country’s biggest academic and medical referral facilities, the D. Twe High School and Redemption Hospital from extinction.
