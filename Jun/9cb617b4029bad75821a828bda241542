Sierra Leone is set to receive US $4.9m funding from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) to finance remaining and final stages in developing the Bumbuna II hydropower project, the country’s largest infrastructure project. The project is part of the government’s long-term Energy Plan, playing a critical energy infrastructure role which will help to reduce the country’s dependence on fossils fuels and emergency power by providing affordable base load power for Sierra Leone.
