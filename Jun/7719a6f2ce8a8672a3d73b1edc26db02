Morocco is set to commence the construction of the world’s largest sea water desalination plant in 2021, at the Southern Coastal City of Agadir. The US $301m Douira Sea Water Desalination plant is expected to have a treatment capacity of 75 million cubic meters of water per year. Abengoa, a Spanish company has been chosen by the Moroccan National Electricity and Drinking water Office (ONEE) to construct this new desalination plant. First, it will offer drinking water for the people of Ctouka Ait Baha region. It will also irrigate 15,000 hectares of land since the farmers of this region have also chipped in to finance the construction of the station. It will also promote the desire towards exploring sustainable energy in Africa through operating on wind power. The plant is expected to produce nearly 275,000 cubic meters of desalinated water daily before reaching its maximum capacity of 450,000 cubic meters per day.
