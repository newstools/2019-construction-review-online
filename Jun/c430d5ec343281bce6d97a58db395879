They will be located in the Analamanga and Vakinakarata regions with the energy produced providing electricity to nearly 50,000 households. The three projects are the first of a 50 MW portfolio Tryba intends to build in Madagascar. Within nine months, the plants are projected to 5 MW of electricity. The resulting production will be sold to local utility Jirama. In the recent past, climate change has made electricity distribution in Madagascar very unreliable with the rate of access to electricity in major towns standing at 15% and barely 5% in rural areas. blackouts due to falling water levels in the country’s main dams had become more and more frequent with power interruptions being experienced for about two hours on a daily basis. However, according to the Minister, construction of these three solar power plants will improve the current situation. He further said that the government’s objective is to increase the access rate to 50%.The nation’s cumulative installed solar capacity was only 33 MW at the end of last year.
