The continued development of Tanzania’s energy sector is critical to the country’s ability to grow economically, attract FDI and expand its commercial ties regionally and globally. Tanzania has an installed generation capacity of 1,513 MW, or 0.033 kW per capita. Electricity demand in the country is increasing rapidly mainly due to foreign investments and an increasing population. Additionally, the government is also encouraging investments to increase available generation, further expand electricity access, reform the distribution system, and develop new indigenous sources of energy. The Public Private Partnership (PPP) Act of 2010 and the Private Partnership Regulations passed in 2011 were enacted to support private sector investment under PPPs. The government’s long term vision aims at increasing connectivity from 30% to 50% by 2025; increasing power generation capacity to at least 5,000 MW by 2020; diversify energy sources for power generation; reduce system losses; and promote regional grid inter connectivity.
