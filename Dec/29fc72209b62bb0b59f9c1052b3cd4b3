Construction of the US$385m new Kipevu Oil Terminal (KOT) is 40 per cent completed after eleven months of work, according to Kenya Ports Authority. The project which is being developed by China Communications Construction Company(CCCC), began on February 1, aiming to be completed in 30 months. They expect is to be completed by August 1, 2021. With the Kenya Ports Authority being the contractor of the new terminal, they will see the current 50-year old Kipevu Oil Terminal relocated to a new site on the southern side of the port (near Dongo Kundu), opposite the current container terminal. Bernard Osero, head of corporate affairs at KPA reported that they are within the timelines in expanding capacity in oil handling reasonably ahead of demand. Also, read Kenya to construct oil terminal at the port of Mombasa. The new terminal is expected to have the capacity to handle four vessels of up to 100,000 tonnes and will have a Liquified Petroleum Gas line that is expected to help stabilise cooking gas supply in the country. Right now, the country depends on the old Kipevu Oil Terminal and the Shimanzi terminal near the Likoni Ferry channel to offload oil product, both of which can only handle one oil tanker at a time. The Kipevu Oil Terminal will supplement the two facilities at Shimanzi and the previous Kipevu terminal. The construction of the oil terminal is part of the authority’s expansion programme which is key to securing the country’s energy needs. Ongoing works at the new terminal include marine piling, the process of building deep foundations into the ground below sea level to support buildings and structures that are offshore. The new Kipevu Oil Terminal will have both subsea and land-based pipelines connecting it to the storage facilities in Kipevu, and the capacity to handle five different fuel products. These include crude oil, heavy fuel oil and three types of white oil products (DPK-aviation fuel, AGO-Diesel and PMS-Petrol).
