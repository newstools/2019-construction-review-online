Benin has awarded a tender for the installation of solar street lights to Fonroche Eclairage, the subsidiary of the Fonroche group, which specialises in public lighting and renewable energy production. The West African country has awarded the lucrative US $24.2m contract for the supply and installation of 15,000 solar street lights. Fonroche was chosen by the Beninese authorities to provide public lighting in several localities in the country. The call for expressions of interest was launched as part of the Paving Project, in the context of President Patrice Talon’s government’s action plan. The Paving Project will also allow the development of green spaces, the purchase of security equipment and urban real estate in several cities in Benin.

He also clarified that the lights will operate 365 days a year without interruption and will not require maintenance for ten years. The 15,000 streetlights will be equipped with connected sensors. This will allow Fonroche teams, who will also maintain the installations, to be able to monitor the operation of the streetlights remotely. Thus, if one of them does not provide sufficient lighting on a street corner, they are able to adjust it from a control centre. Fonroche’s new contract strengthens its entry into West African markets. In Senegal, the company won a contract worth US $96.6m to supply 50,000 solar streetlights in several cities across the country. The company, which employs 200 people, is also present in Central Africa. In April 2019, it delivered solar street lamps in Etam Bafia, a slum area in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
