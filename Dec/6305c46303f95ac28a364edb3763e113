The African Development Bank (AfDB) has approved US $210m for Transmission Company of Nigeria’s (TCN), NTEP -1 projects in a board resolution in Abidjan. The NTEP is one of the projects under TREP (The rural electrification program) financed by AfDB that is targeted at rehabilitating and expanding parts of the transmission grid in the North West, South South and the South East of Nigeria. The project would reconstruct old transmission lines and build new ones as well as construct new substations, contributing to further increase in TCN’s transmission capacity. TCN General Manager (Public Affairs), Ndidi Mbah, stated that even though the approval has just been given, the company had already concluded environmental studies including the resettlement action plan in which people that would be affected by the acquisition of the Right of Way (RoW) for the proposed transmission lines were identified and the report submitted to AfDB.
