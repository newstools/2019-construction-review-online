Construction of the Lacmon to Apaa (Section 1&2) road in Pabbo Sub-County in Uganda has been blocked by the armed personnel of the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). The 20km road worth US $459,000 is expected to link remote areas of Lakang through Kololo to Kampala landing site on the Nile river bank. The road construction is being undertaken by Davrich Company LTD under the Project for Restoration of Livelihoods in Northern Uganda (PRELNOR), a government initiative for the nine districts of Amuru, Nwoya, Pader, Omoro, Gulu, Lamwo, Agago, Kitgum and Adjumani under the control of the Ministry of Local Government. The armed rangers issued a directive to halt the road construction process because it was passing through the gazetted East Madi Conservation Area under Adjumani district local government. Additionally, UWA said that the district did not conduct a social environmental impact assessment for the project.

The project entails: improvement of 62 km of roads, 123 km of non-motorized traffic facilities, provision of street lighting; provision of scheduled eco- bus services with supporting infrastructure (bus depot and dedicated lanes). The project is expected to benefit at least 1.6 million people including: commuters, businesses, and transporters passing through the city regularly, poised to experience improved transport efficiency.
