The installation will see to the production of solar energy using an offgrid operational configuration. Energy that will be produced by the Adam photovoltaic plant will be used directly by industrial facilities and will help to reduce gas consumption while saving over 6,500 tons of CO2 emissions per year. The Adam Photovoltaic Plant in Tunisia was constructed under a cooperation agreement with ETAP which is focused on the development of renewable energy generation projects in Tunisia. It also includes a 2.2 MWp/1.5MWh storage battery system that will enable integration with existing gas turbines inorder to  ensure optimization of operating costs. This hybrid generation system, which combines gas, photovoltaic and storage, is one of the most innovative in the world. Within the Tataouine region that is under the Eni–ETAP cooperation agreement, works are also underway on an additional photovoltaic plant in the city of Tataouine, which will have an installed capacity of 10 MW. This project was unertaken after a public tender that was issued by the Tunisian Energy Ministry. It also  included supplying green electricity to the national company, Société Tunisienne de l’Electricité et du Gaz (STEG). These initiatives confirms Eni’s commitment to the decarbonisation of Tunisia’s energy systems, leading towards an increasingly low-carbon scenario, in which renewable energies are a fundamental and integrated element of its energy mix.
