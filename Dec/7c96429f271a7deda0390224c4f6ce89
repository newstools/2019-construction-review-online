Construction of Blitta power plant is set to kick off after the Togolese government entrusted the project to Amea Togo Solar. The subsidiary of the Emirates-based company Amea Power will implement it as part of a public-private partnership (PPP). Two related concession agreements have recently been signed. The first was established between Dèdèriwè Ably Bidamon, the Togolese Minister of Mines and Energy and Hussain Jasim Naser Mohamed Alnowais, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Amea Power. Amea Togo Solar will design, finance and build the Blitta solar power plant in two phases. The first, which will be delivered by June 2020, will allow the construction of a power plant capable of producing 30MWp. The second phase will provide a facility with a capacity of 20MWp. A power purchase agreement was also signed between Hussain Jasim Naser Mohamed Alnowais and Mawussi Kakatsi, the General Manager of the Electric Power Company of Togo (CEET). Amea Power will invest US $33.7m in the implementation of the Blitta solar photovoltaic project.

On the same roadmap, the country plans to build a total of four 30MWp solar power plants. The objective is to provide access to electricity for the entire population of the West African country by 2030. Amea Power, which is currently conquering the African solar energy market, would also be interested in the Dapaong (30 MWp) solar project in the Savannah region of northern Togo. This independent power producer (IPP) is also present in Central Africa, with a concession obtained near N’Djamena in Chad.
