Equatorial Guinea is set to develop a gas megahub in Punta Europa after it signed a Strategic Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Vitol. The project is expected to establish a modern, flexible gas processing and export system that will be of service to the needs of growing gas demands in the region and the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.

Location Equatorial Guinea will develop the gas megahub in the north of Bioko Island and close to Cameroon and Nigeria. It will facilitate a cross-border link with gas projects in those countries and open the door for the establishment of new hubs to be of service to the region. The Gas Megahub will also help reduce the dependency on single upstream producers for industrial development and will combine with new subsea pipelines linking the country’s Aseng, Alen and Alba fields, the project will pave way for gas to be re-directed to maximize efficiencies. Utilizing the Punta Europa-Alba-Alen infrastructure, the Gas Megahub will be able to connect the country to new gas discoveries, drive monetization of stranded gas, augment fuel exports and boost internal revenues.
