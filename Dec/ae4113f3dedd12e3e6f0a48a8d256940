Construction of Pwalugu multi-purpose dam in the Upper East Region of Ghana has officially commenced. This is after President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo cut the sod to mark the start of the construction. The project which is expected to cost the government nearly US $1bn will be undertaken by Sinohydro Power, a Chinese construction firm. The contractor is expected to start work immediately and complete the construction work within 50 months. The Pwalugu multi-purpose dam is located on the White Volta River on the boundary of the Upper East and North East regions. The President noted that the project was the biggest single investment that any government had ever made in northern part of Ghana and it is expected to promote sustained growth and development. He also explained that the project consisted of three main components including a dam with an elevation of 165m and maximum reservoir of 350 square kilometres.

The President also noted that the construction of the dam will serve as a receptor to hold large volumes of water spill from the Bagre Dam for irrigation purposes and generation of electricity; and will also be a permanent solution to the problem of spillage from the Bagre Dam. The project is expected to boost the growth of Ghana’s economy through increased solar energy supply and enhanced agriculture production thereby reducing imports and ensuring effective perennial flood control. President Akufo-Addo explained that the irrigation component of the project would further boost and strengthen the gains already made in the government’s flagship programmes such as One Village One Dam and Planting for Food and Jobs.
