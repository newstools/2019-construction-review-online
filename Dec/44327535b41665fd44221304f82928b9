Construction of modern abattoir in Pangani Ward, Kibaha Town Council in Tanzania which aims at increasing the council’s revenue, is almost complete. District Executive Director Jennifer Omolo told Acting Chairman of the Association of Local Authorities of Tanzania (ALAT), Stephen Mhapa who was accompanied by ALAT General-Secretary Elirehema Kaaya during a one-day tour to inspect government projects that apart from increasing revenue, the abattoir would provide residents with quality and safe meat, among other benefits. Ms Omolo noted that the project was launched in April this year and was divided into two phases of which phase one was almost completed. “Completion of this abattoir, which has the capacity of slaughtering 100 cattle per day, will help business people from different regions passing here to Dar es Salaam to get services, to be served right here which will make them save time and money,” she noted.
