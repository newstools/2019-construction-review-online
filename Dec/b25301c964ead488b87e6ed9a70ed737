The government of Zimbabwe is set to urgently start the construction of Manyame and Warren Control Pump stations in two monthsâ€™ time in a quest to elevate water shortages in Harare and its surrounding towns. This is after the government allocated US $9.3m following a report that row water from Lake Chivero is not good for human consumption and it is expensive to treat. The report further stated that pumping water from Lake Manyame would reduce the usage of aluminium sulphate by 26.8%, consequently reducing the cost of water treatment as aluminium sulphate is the main chemical in the water treatment process. July Moyo, the Minister of Local Government and Public Works said that the installation of appropriate water meters will be undertaken concurrently with the cited works to keep up with the scheduled timeframe.
