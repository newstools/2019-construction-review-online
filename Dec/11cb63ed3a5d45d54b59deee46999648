The government of Kenya has announced plans to give Wilson Airport a major facelift. The airport, which is mainly used for domestic flights, has lately come under scrutiny over the quality of its runway after two planes skidded off the runway. The first incident involved a Silverstone plane that crashed on the runway shortly after take-off. The plane that was heading to Lamu had five crew members and 50 passengers on board. Two people were injured. The second incident involved a SafariLink plane that skidded off the runway, but no injuries were reported. The two accidents prompted the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA), the regulator, to conduct an audit inspection of the airline to determine the level of compliance with civil aviation regulations. Speaking in Nairobi, KCAA Director General Gilbert Kibe said the airport would now receive “comprehensive” renovations, which had been necessitated by several factors that hinder the optimum functioning of the airport. The Director General noted that Wilson Airport is now handling about one million passengers a year, though it was designed for half that number. “This has resulted in congestion, especially by larger aircraft. One such aircraft can occupy the space of about four small ones,” he continued. He said the rehabilitation plan was passed at a recent stakeholders’ meeting where KCAA was among the participants. Kibe further said the airport would have to be decongested of the larger planes for the repairs to begin and later on proceed without inconveniencing the construction workers. Targeted for makeover include: the airport’s runway, taxiway, apron, along with other key infrastructure.
