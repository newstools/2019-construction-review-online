He explained that the lights last for 30 straight hours after an 8-hour charge and automatically turn-on at night and turn-off at day break. “There is a renewed sense of safety and security in Ezeagbogu since the completion of this project, especially around Eke Ezeagbogu which is the center of economic activities in this community. This will increase the number of business hours available to the people here and influenced positively their struggle against hunger and poverty,” said Mr Kikuta. The governor noted that all hands must be on deck to ensure that the project is maintained for maximum impact and further re-instituted the monthly clean-up exercise in the state. “We have additionally re instituted the monthly Governor’s Prize to be given to the cleanest local government area in the state as well as the cleanest autonomous community, primary school and secondary school, respectively in each local government area. A planning, sensitization and implementation committee has been appointed and approved for the July 2019 clean-up exercise,” said Governor Emeka. Renewable energy has considerable potential in Nigeria, and could bridge the major energy gaps in rural areas, particularly northern Nigeria. The scale of opportunities is only just becoming apparent as new grid technologies such as concentrated solar power are emerging as in competitors with conventional power generation.
