South Africa has begun construction works of 140 MW Garob wind farm located near the town of Copperton, Siyathemba Local Municipality,  a few weeks after it broke ground for the 140MW Oyster Bay wind project, in the Kouga Local Municipality of the country’s Eastern Cape province.

Enel Green Power RSA (EGP RSA) a renewable arm of Italy’s Enel SpA was awarded the new project during the fourth bidding window under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP). Once fully operational in mid-2021, Garob wind farm is anticipated to generate around 573 GWh annually, bringing to an end the emission of about 600,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Enel Green Power has plans to launch Enterprise Development (ED) initiatives in the communities residing close to the wind farm once Garob is operational. This initiatives include the Herbal Lean Incubation Programme, which shall be providing mentorship and support services to start-ups in the agro, bio and food technology field. Earlier, the company had implemented sustainability projects in the Northern Cape such as the installation of an artificial turf football field that captures and stores rainwater.  The harvested rainwater is then cleaned by use of a water purification facility to addressing water shortages and providing clean drinking water to the Northern Cape occupants. Other initiatives include establishment of free Wi-Fi to local communities, in an effort to support public authorities’ plans to roll out free Wi-Fi networks in under-served communities.
