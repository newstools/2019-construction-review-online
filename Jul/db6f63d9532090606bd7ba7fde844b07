Currently it is now almost impassable thereby hampering the free and smooth movement of vehicular movements between the two sister states. The project contract was awarded by the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing at the heat of the electioneering campaigns to mobilize votes in the South-South for the second term of President Muhammadu Buhari. Its contract number is 6321 with Design Construct Ltd as supervising consultant while Julius Berger Nigeria Plc is the portfolio contractor. Residents in the area raised concerns over the project halt and lamented that currently it is now almost impassable thereby hampering the free and smooth movement of vehicular movements between the two sister states. Only two kilometer was worked on. “All the equipment mobilized to the site before the general election have been removed by the company without any explanation to the security men in the premises. The result is owing backlog of salaries to workers working on the project,” stated area resident. From Ididep to Ekim Itam leading to Ekoriko junction, a cyclist Mr Uduak Akpan Udoh complained that the potholes left on the road by Julius Berger has worsened the condition of the road for both motorists and pedestrians.
