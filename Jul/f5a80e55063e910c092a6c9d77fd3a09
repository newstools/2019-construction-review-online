However, in March this year President John Magufuli directed Tanzania People’s Defence force (TPDF) to take over the project after TBA had failed to complete it on time. The order  came after the president made a surprise visit to the construction site and found out that the both the Tanzania Building Agency and the Prisons Department have been so lax in making sure that the project was completed. TBA and Prisons Department have failed to implement the housing project for prisons officers on time despite the release of the fund by the government thus will not partake the works to allow the army to start work without delay,” said the President The project involves the construction of a 12-four storey building to house prison wardens and is now implemented by the National Service. According to auditor General Edward Ouko, staff housing at prisons where some warders live are filthy dilapidated mud and rusting mabati huts. ‘Sanitation’ is primitive to nonexistent. He noted that he Prisons department needs at least 20,000 new housing units “Lack of proper housing also affects officers’ family life as most said they don’t live with their families on prison grounds due to lack of decent accommodation,” said Ouko.
