It is estimated that road transport accounts for 96% of passenger and freight traffic in Ghana and about 97% of passenger miles in the country. According to the Ministry of Roads and Transport, Ghana’s road transport infrastructure is made up of 63,122km of road network linking the entire country as at the end of 2006. The network consisted of 12,786km of trunk roads, 40,671km of Feeder roads and 9,764km of urban roads. The road network had increased to 13,367km of trunk roads, 42,100km of feeder roads and 12,600km of urban roads.On the whole, traffic densities are low, except in the large cities of Accra and Kumasi, where peak hour densities are relatively high. The intention is to have many of the existing highways tolled and private-sector participation in road construction and ownership.
