The stretch would be tolled and axle-weighing facilities provided to control overloading. It will additionally, create about 1,500 direct jobs in the region. Other lenders for the development include; the Opec Fund for International Development, the Ghanaian Government and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which was financing a connecting bridge across the Volta River. The Project is to be implemented over a five-year period from 2018 to 2022. “With this project we hope to turn rural areas from areas of economic challenges to economic prosperity and bread baskets,” said Marie-Laure Akin-Olugbade, Bank Director for West Africa. AfDB’s leadership role in transport infrastructure development in the country has stimulated interest and alliances with several development partners in the country. The Eastern Corridor project aligns with the bank’s 10-year strategy and three of the High 5 priorities.
