Construction on the Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal Assembly Hospital road in the Greater Accra Region Ghana has resumed following the release of US $3.2m by the government for work to continue. The 7.5-kilometre stretch popularly known as the LEKMA road, which connects the Spintex Road to the Accra-Tema Beach road and the only alternative route to residential areas around the Manet Estate, off the Spintex road, has stalled since 2016. Patients visiting the LEKMA Hospital have had to endure the discomfort of bumpy rides on the potholes-ridden stretch and the nature of the road makes it difficult for emergency cases to be rushed in because drivers always have to slow down in order to bring in patients safely and not worsen their condition. Nearly every surface of the LEKMA Hospital is covered in dust, with the operating theatre also having its fair share.
