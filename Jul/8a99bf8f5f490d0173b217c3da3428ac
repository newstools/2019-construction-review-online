Morocco has kicked off construction of a high-tech city in Northern Tangier. This comes after China Communications Construction Co (CCCC) and its subsidiary, China Road and Bridge Corp (CRBC) and Morocco-based BMCE Bank signed a memorandum of understanding in April for the development. The agreement to construct the city known as Tanger Tech Mohammed VI was signed after the withdrawal of China’s Haite group with which BMCE and the northern regional council had expressed interest in 2017 to develop the city in the next 10 years. “There were disagreements on the ownership of the city among other issues. Our partners are Chinese but this does not mean that the city belongs to Chinese,” said Ilyas El Omari, head of the northern Tangier-Tetouan-Alhoceima region.
