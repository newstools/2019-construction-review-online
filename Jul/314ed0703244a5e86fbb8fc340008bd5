Most of the roads that are being tarmacked are used by heavy trailers to and from the many industries in the area and for this reason they make the roads to fall into ruin faster. The roads have been expanded to a width of approximately 7.5 meters, with walkways. Hon Wainaina said that the contractors, all of whom are locals, have been instructed by the Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) to strictly use durable technologies in order to build roads that can last even up to 12 years. The BAT-Kiganjo and the Athena-Witeithie-Thika Super Highway; a bypass intended to ease congestion on the busy Thika-Garissa Highway are some of the roads been tarmacked.  The MP added that street lights will be installed along the roads to enhance security and also create a 24 hour economy.
