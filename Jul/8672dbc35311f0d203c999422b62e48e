The Community and the people must consider themselves lucky for having a governor that is interested in bringing projects home. For more than 8 years we have had this golly erosion site and in less than two months, the project has been flagged off. That for us is a mark of leadership,” said Governor Ihedioha. “We are in a hurry to redevelop Imo state and we will stop at nothing to restore the glory days of the state. Records available to us suggest that huge amount of money was mapped out by the previous administration to remedy the menace of erosion in Idea to north and other places, sadly but unsurprisingly, the projects were not carried out and the funds were not accounted for, leaving the residents at the mercy of flooding for the past five years,” he added.
