The construction work will now begin at the third section- Agboju to Trade Fair Complex- and it is expected to last for one year. The sections 1 and 2 of the expressway- from Eric Moore to Agboju have been completed. Dr Obafemi lauded the cooperation between the Federal Government and the state government, saying the Federal Road Emergency Maintenance Agency (FERMA) was currently rehabilitating the Igboelerin section to Agbara road while the Federal Ministry of Works was building a six -lane road from Agbara to Seme Border. He further added that the project will bring relief to millions of Lagosians who live on the axis considered as an international route and end the neglect and hardship suffered daily by residents of that part of the metropolis, where traffic snarl, robbery and deaths have become a daily experience. He said the project, which is a transit oriented development, would open up the area for economic activities and real estate, adding that it would complement the 13 stations of the Blue Line Rail Project and 10-lane Lagos-Badagry Express road.
