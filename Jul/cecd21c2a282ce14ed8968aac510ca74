Morocco has launched tender call for pre-qualification (RfQ) relating to the 230-MW Noor Midelt II solar power plant project. The Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy, launched the tender and said that it marks the beginning of stage one of the process to select a private partner to design, finance, build and operate the particular solar park with a storage component.

Made up of two solar plants, the Noor Midelt solar project will combine thermosolar and photovoltaic technology to produce 800 MW of renewable energy, with a storage capacity of 5 hours. The hybrid technology will optimize energy production, leading to competitive pricing (MAD 0.68 per KwH at peak time). The Noor Midelt project is partly financed by the World Bank. The bank provided US $125m towards the project last year. The solar plant will be Morocco’s second concentrated solar power technology complex, after Noor Ouarzazate. The Noor Midelt project is one of Morocco’s broader renewable energy strategy, which has promoted solar, hydroelectric and wind farm projects countrywide. By the end of 2018, Morocco had installed 1,215 MW of wind energy, 1,770 MW in hydropower and 700 MW in solar. The country is planning to produce 52% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. By the end of 2018, Morocco had installed 1,215 MW of wind energy, 1,770 MW in hydropower and 700 MW in solar.
