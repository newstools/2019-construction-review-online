It is expected to link Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique as well as unlock massive economic opportunities for the Kanyemba border town. The project which is being funded by the Japan government, will boost trade among the three countries while it revives operations on the border post which had retreated into a ghost point due to inactivity, with a broad forecast of further linking with the rest of Central Africa. The road project will also include establishment of a floating bridge that will be used as a deck to ferry heavy trucks across the Zambezi into Zambia and Mozambique. The Kanyemba road will provides an alternative to the North-South Corridor initiative within the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region. It is also part of a corridor-long infrastructure improvement program that enhances regional trade and integration. Supportive infrastructure such as the road network to the area will be worked on and 5 kilometres of the approach road to the pontoon landing bay is complete with a drivable surface. The project was granted national project status with at least US $24m allocated toward the capital projects in the area bordering Zambia and Mozambique. Developments of the Kanyemba and the Kazungula are part of Zimbabweâ€™s 2030 vision of transforming the country into a middle income economy. It is scheduled for completion in 2020.
