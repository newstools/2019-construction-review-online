The harbor basin provides the space to dredge deeper and build additional wharves if required. It can currently accommodate up to 20 berths depending on vessel size with MPS operating on 4 berths. The new MPS Terminal 3 upon completion in 2020, is expected to further improve port productivity and capacity. Anticipated trade-cost reduction will lead to an increase in trade volume and turnover for Ghana importers and exporters. This will in turn generate value to the economy along with the creation of new jobs. The hub port in Tema will connect Ghana to Africa’s consumer markets through direct services, shorter transit times and competitive sea freight rates. It is expected to attract further investment in facilities and factories around Tema Port. The Tema Port Expansion Project is spearheaded by MPS, a joint venture between Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (30%), APM Terminals (35%) and Bolloré Transport and Logistics (35%). The port will be the largest and most efficient container terminal on the Western Coast of Africa with a deepest water draft. It has the potential to catapult Africa into a different level in the world shipping industry by creating new service routes and connections, and opening up the market for Africa.
