Works remaining include construction of 8 kilometers pipeline from Margaret Mwachiyeya to Chongwe Town. According to Fair Water Futures, the water crisis in Chongwe was driven by poor management, illegal water use, lax regulation and a lack of policy implementation and accountability to water users. The water shortage imposed severe hardship, extra expense and health risks on the people of the residents. The project according to Amos is a long term intervention to the water challenges in the district. He commended the President Edgar Lungu for the quick response to the cries of the people and observed that this was a clear indication that government had attached great importance to the plight of its people. “It is envisaged that the Chongwe Water Supply Improvement Project will, in the mid to long term period address the water supply challenges that have been experienced in the recent past. The Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) was supplying water in bowsers to help in the water crisis.,” said Amos Zulu.
