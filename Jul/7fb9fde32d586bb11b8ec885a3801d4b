Liberia has commissioned the rehabilitated road connecting New Life, Dour Town and other communities in Margibi District #1. Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, the District Representative, Tilberosa S. Tarponweh said that the roads have officially been turned over to the public for use. The 1.9 kilometers rehabilitated road connects the Doe Estate, owned and formerly occupied by employees of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA), Dour Town, New Life and several other communities in the part of Margibi County bordering Montserrado Electoral District #4. Before the rehabilitation of the road, it was deplorable and sometimes impassable, especially during the rainy season. The New Life Community’s chairman, Andrew B. Roberts, lauded Rep. Tarponweh for the initiative, and pledged to rally the support of his fellow residents to maintain the road. “The road will now bring relief and enhance free movement of goods and services at all times,” said Roberts.
