The road will also connect with the Great North Highway, an African Development Bank (AfDB) financed project, that is expected to link Kenya to Ethiopia. According to the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), the Kenol-Sagana-Marua road will be financed in two lots which will be constructed simultaneously. The first lot will be conversion of Kenol-Sagana section to a dual carriageway, going through Makutano in Mwea while the second lot will see Sagana-Marua section converted into a bypass connecting roads at Karatina, in Nyeri County. The design review for the two lots, which cover 48 kilometer between Kenol and Sagana, and 32 kilometer between Sagana and Marua will be undertaken by Consultants who shall win the tender. The expansion of the Kenol-Sagana-Marua highway coded A2 is predicted to have major impact in the regions it cuts through, which are Murang’a, Kirinyaga, Nyeri, Machakos and Embu counties. Traveling time between Nyeri and Nairobi will be cut down by at least one hour and upon completion the highway will open up the northern corridor and create employment opportunities for thousands of residents in the agriculture, tourism, small and medium-sized enterprises sectors.
