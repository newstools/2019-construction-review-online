South Africa’s Cape Town Executive Mayor Dan Plato has officially opened  the new  V&A Waterfront which connects the Clock Tower and Pierhead. The bridge was first constructed in 1997 when there was less pedestrian traffic but with new developments at the Silo district and the growing population a larger bridge was needed. An estimate of about 180,000 and 240,000 pedestrians cross the bridge every month depending on season and events. This led to bridge undergoing t a US $1.4m revamp.

When required, the bridge can be swung away to allow ships free passage on their journey to the sea. The new bridge will rotate on one bearing similar to a crane power, it is mechanically advanced and increases capacity during peak periods. In addition advanced technology will ensure that the bridge requires less mechanical maintenance. “The V&A Waterfront is one of our tourism hubs, becoming one of the central places where locals and tourists can embark on sightseeing trips, boat cruises, cultural experiences, shopping and entertainment. I am pleased to see that the V&A Waterfront management continue to invest in the space to support its growing appeal and contribute positively to the city’s economic growth and performance. The V&A Waterfront is one of the first places that tourists visit and it is also popular among Capetonians, offering a world-class space and scenery,” said Plato.
