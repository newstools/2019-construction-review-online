The former (Tullow Oil) assessed that the basin contains an estimated 560 million barrels in proven and probable reserves, that can translate to a gross production of between 60,000 and 100,000 barrels per day. Together with the processing facility, the consortium also plans to establish a crude oil export pipeline from Lokichar to Lamu in the coastal region. According to the signed MoU, they are now focusing on securing financing for pipeline project. In a statement, Tullow oil Kenya noted that this infrastructure is installed as the foundation stage that will be utilized for the development of the remaining oil fields and future oil discoveries in the region, allowing the incremental development of these fields to be completed at the lowest unit cost possible.
