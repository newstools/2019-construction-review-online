According to Floyd Thomas, the bridge which is being built to meet international standards, will last for 80-100 years. Currently, residents and passengers in the area are using canoes to transport goods and services because of the ongoing project as prices of basic commodities are sky-rocketing, but the people are hopeful that upon completion of the bridge, things will return to normal. “The government is equally concerned of its people and is doing everything possible to improve their welfare. We shall put in place all necessary security mechanisms to avoid undermining of the bridge by illegal sand miners,” said Public Works Minister Mobutu Nyenpan.
