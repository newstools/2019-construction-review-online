The Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa has approved a term loan facility to fund the construction of Phase 1 of the Makhado hard coking coal project. David Brown, CEO of MC Mining, confirmed the reports and said that the loan reaffirms the economics of the Makhado project and follows the conclusion of off-take agreements for the coal to be produced by Phase 1. “The loan reflects the IDC’s support for the development of the Makhado Project and replaces the 2017 financing that was utilized to fund pre-project activities, including securing the numerous regulatory licences and approvals,” said CEO Brown.
