Each turbine will produce 3.45 MW. They will rotate with light blades to provide electricity in areas where there is little wind. Vestas will also carry out all civil engineering work, from the foundations to the installation of the mast carrying the turbine and blades. The wind turbines will be equipped with the VestasOnline Business SCADA system, which allows remote monitoring of the park’s electricity production. After the delivery of the site planned for the second half of 2020. Vesta will start the maintenance contract for the Wesley-Ciskei wind farm. “The Wesley-Ciskei wind project is of great importance to the Eastern Cape Province. It is the first and only wind energy project located in a former region of the Eastern Cape Province, although this region represents nearly 40% of the province’s land mass and is home to 60% of the province’s population,” says EDF.
