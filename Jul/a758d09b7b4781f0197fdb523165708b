The Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) has commissioned US $2.7m footbridge at Kenyatta University ahead of next year’s IAAF under-20 championships which will be held at Moi Sports Centre, Kasarani. The 100-metre long bridge which is the longest in the country was constructed to help thousands of athletes who will be crossing over from and to Nyayo Hostels in the University where they will be accommodated between July 7-12, 2020.

The risk of train accidents has been minimized since we expect them now to use the bridge to cross the railway line underneath,” said Henry Mulwa. “The designing of this bridge took time bearing in mind the population of Kenyatta University students who will be using it daily. We asked the contractors to make sure the design meets the safety needs of the students,” Silas Kinoti, acting Director-General of KURA added. KURA has over the last six years they have constructed 45 footbridges across the country and established 400 KM footpaths in an effort meant to reduce pedestrian accidents in the country.
