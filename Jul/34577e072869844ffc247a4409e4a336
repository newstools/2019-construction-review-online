Kenya is set to commission Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) in Marsabit County, which is the largest wind farm in Africa by President Uhuru Kenyatta. Construction of the mega wind power farm was completed in last year but could not produce power since the Spanish firm contracted to develop the transmission line filed for bankruptcy. However, two Chinese firms took over the construction of the 428 km electricity transmission line to evacuate the power and completed the infrastructure in August this year.
