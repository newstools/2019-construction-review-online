The companies are Egypt’s Orascom Construction, France’s GD France, and Japan’s Toyota. The project is been developed with financial assistance from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Union, the French Development Agency (AFD), and the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ). Under the supervision of the New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) of Egypt, the project is built in terms of Build-Own-Operate (BOO) system, a project delivery mechanism in which a government entity sells the right to construct and operate a project for a specified time to a private-sector party, according to agreed design specifications. The current capacity of renewable energy in the Arab republic of Egypt as of now has reached 1,100MW. This represents 10.5% of the total energy produced in the country; 1.5% solar and wind, and 9% hydropower. El-Khayat pointed out that renewable energy beats traditional energy in terms of cost easing the burden on the general budget. Furthermore, he noted that recent economic reforms, for example the liberalization of local exchange rate and fuel subsidy cuts allows the government to adopt the BOO scheme, in which the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) is committed to purchase the energy produced according to the contract price.
