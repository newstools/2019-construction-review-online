The Addis Ababa City Administration in Ethiopia has began the construction of Adwa Center (also the anti-colonial struggle memorial center), in the heart of the city. The Center is being constructed on a piece of land that was initially given out to the Ethiopian born Saudi Billionaire Mohammed Ali Al Amoudi’s company, Midroc Construction but later taken back by the city administration. The structure of Adwa Center is intended to commemorate the triumph of Adwa and Patriots. It will reflect the history of the victory in its entirety. Adwa center will consist of a museum, a meeting hall with a total capacity of over 2000 people, three smaller auditoriums with a capacity of 400 people, a 600 car capacity parking space, a cinema theater, a library, a gym, cafeterias and a childcare center among other leisure facilities.

Adwa victory is regarded as an African victory. This is because it is the first ever African victory over European colonizers. It has strengthened other African countries’ struggle against their colonial masters in order to attain independence. The Chinese firm, China Jiangsu International Economic and Technical Cooperation, is expected to finish the construction of the memorial center in two years time.
