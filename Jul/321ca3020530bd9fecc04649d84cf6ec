The Harava Solar project comes at a time Zimbabwe is reeling from massive power shortages, which have resulted in long hours of load shedding to manage demand. Mr Ngadya announced that the Government has waived duty on solar equipment to promote its use in the country to fight power shortages, noting that the move was a positive improvement that will certainly unleash further investments in the clean energy sector. Government believes the removal of duty on solar equipment will spur investments in the sector and reduce demand for grid electricity. Some IPPs have previously complained that the current average tariff of US $9,86 per kilowatt hour was not sustainable, hence the challenges in accessing funds to implement power projects.
