The construction works on Kangnas wind farm project situated approximately 46 km outside of Springbok, in the Northern Capeâ€™s Nama Khoi Municipal area, South Africa, is moving on swiftly. This after the contractor simultaneously completed the erection of the first of its 61 wind turbines and its final turbine foundation slightly ahead of schedule and within budget. Mainstream Renewable Power, a Sweden-based independent power producer (IPP) in charge of the development, has ceremoniously announced that they are positive the project whose construction works commenced in June 2018, will be delivered on time to allow for its commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020. The wind farm is expected to generate 140MW of clean renewable power from its sixty-one wind turbines during operations. With Concor and Concor Consortium as the contractors, the US $246m wind farm constructed on a 3 591 hectares piece of land, will consist of a total of 61 wind turbines supplied and installed by Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, each with a capacity of 2.3 MW. The turbines are 168m high and are equipped with a three-bladed rotor with a diameter of 108m each. Every single turbine is mounted on a 115m high tubular steel tube tower and will run at an average speed of 15rpm. The project also includes the construction of a 12.8km long 132kV dual circuit overhead line and a substation to increase the voltage from 132kV to 220kV. It is from these installations that the electricity will be fed into the National grid in order to power up to 120,000 households in the country.
