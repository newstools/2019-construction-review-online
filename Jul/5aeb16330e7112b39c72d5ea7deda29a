The contractors will receive the balance after the work is satisfactorily done. That would leave them with the third payment retention fee after six months,” said Mr Rafiu. The new secretariat complex will comprise of four blocks with each of the blocks having 76 office spaces. According to the CPS, the project needs to be completed as quick as possible for the usability of the civil servants of the state, which is the core reason behind the pushing for discount for the state as well from the contractors.
