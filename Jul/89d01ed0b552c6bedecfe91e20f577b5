The Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA) is set to demolish the historic Makupa Causeway that links Mombasa Island to the Kenyan mainland and construct a new bridge in the next one year. The 120 meters Makupa causeway structure between Tudor and Port Reitz creeks was built in the 1920â€™s by the British colonial government and it has reportedly been interfering with the natural oceanic waves, the free flow of aqueous oxygen and it has also been a cause of damage to fish breeding grounds, besides bring about pollution.

The new bridge, contracted to Third China Engineering Company, is also intended to accommodate the old railway line and KeNHA was reported earlier to be in talks with the Kenya Railways on how to incorporate the standard gauge railway in the infrastructure as well. Mr. Omer, also revealed that the Authority aspires to begin construction of Likoni Bridge and another bridge at Dongo Kundu during the same time that construction of the Makupa causeway bridge begins. He said that the Likoni gateway bridge will be approximately 1.6 kilometers long and high enough to enable ships going to the port of Mombasa to pass under it. KeNHA has identified a contractor for the construction of the Dongo Kundu Bridge while another contractor is already on site to build the southern section of the road.
