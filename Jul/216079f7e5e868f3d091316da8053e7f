The turbines received type certification in January 2017 and are some of the latest versions of onshore wind turbines currently available. Each is set to produce 3.45MW. The wind turbines will utilise a 117m tubular steel tower and a blade length of 61.7m, giving a large swept area of 12,469m², allowing the wind turbines to maximise the amount of energy captured from wind. Upon completion, PETN will produce 158MW, representing a 15% uplift to Senegal’s generation capacity and providing energy for 2 million people. The wind farm is expected to begin transmitting electricity to the grid later this year. The wind farm will also be Senegal’s first ever, and largest in West Africa. Lekela has additionally worked with stakeholders to create a 20-year social investment programme that will benefit the local area. This includes initiatives that will create infrastructure and services for workers, and also encourage local enterprise.
