Uganda’s Bunyoro Kitara Kingdom has rejected government’s proposal to construct a hydropower dam in Murchison Falls National Park. In June 7, Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) ran a public notice in the media indicating that it received an application from Bonang Power and Energy (Pty) Limited for a permit to conduct feasibility studies for construction of a hydro power dam on Victoria Nile in the park.

The river and the adjacent riparian landscapes host several flora, fauna and cultural landscapes revered by the people of Bunyoro and used in several cultural and royal rituals,” said Byakutaga. The prime minister also placed emphasis that park has several sacred sites that are critical in the cultural identity of the kingdom and that the park is already under stress from the oil and gas exploration and development activities which will affect its ecological resilience, adding that a dam construction will exacerbate the risk. “Building the dam on the proposed site will affect the Murchison/ Kabalega falls either through changes in the flow regime or sediment transfer. This will affect the flora and fauna around the site yet this is the main touristic attraction in the park,” said Byakutaga. Murchison Falls National Park lies at the northern end of the Albertine Rift Valley, where the sweeping Bunyoro escarpment tumbles into vast, palm-dotted savanna. First gazetted as a game reserve in 1926, it is Uganda’s largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds. The park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 45m over the remnant rift valley wall, creating the dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of rapids. The stretch of river provides one of Uganda’s most remarkable wildlife spectacles. According to the Uganda Wildlife Authority‘s official website, the park has elephants, giraffes and buffaloes; while hippos, Nile crocodiles and aquatic birds. At Murchison falls, River Nile squeezes through an 8 metre wide gorge and plunges with a thunderous roar below a valley, creating a trademark rain ball.
