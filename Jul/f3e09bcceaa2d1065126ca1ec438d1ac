The loan will be paid with interest within 25 years. The new terminal will be the first up to date modern terminal ever at the RIA since the construction of that airport in the 1940s during the Second World War. It features two jet bridges, two escalators, two elevators, ten check-in counters, eight duty free stores, a restaurant and two luggage carousels among several other features. For the runway, Mr. Wilson said it has since been completed with cutting edge technology including a new instrument landing system (ILS) and an Aeronautical Lighting System that is enhancing the landing and takeoff of carriers. The new passenger terminal will process 350,000 to 500,000 passengers per annul, a projection he said suits the future air traffic needs of the Roberts International Airport (RIA). The LAA PR Manager further, mentioned a new office complex that will house the operational and administrative functions of the Airport Authority, as well as offices for airlines and banks operating at RIA. The office complex he intimated, was transformed from the old passenger terminal burned during the war, into a two level office facility.
