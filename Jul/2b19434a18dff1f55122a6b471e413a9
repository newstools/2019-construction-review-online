New York-based IrisVR, whose Prospect for Oculus Quest has recently released for the headset, serves the architecture, engineering and construction sectors. Prospect makes use of the device’s 6DOF capabilities and freedom of movement that comes from being completely untethered to “deliver true-to-scale VR experiences” drawn from Revit, Navisworks, SketchUp, Rhino and other three-dimensional (3D) models. IrisVR chief executive officer and co-founder Shane Scranton believes the mobility and freedom that Quest brings to VR will result in a wide variety of new use cases for the technology within architecture, engineering and construction. Scranton continued: “Here at IrisVR, we believe the increased portability that comes with Oculus Quest will be a game-changer.” “For the first time, you’ll be able to step inside your 3D models in the field office or on the job site without plugging into a computer.” “That means the processes architecture, engineering and construction professionals are using VR for right now—like design review, model coordination, and visual clash detection—are more broadly accessible and easier to get started with than ever.” IrisVR does accept that Oculus Quest has some limitations, namely that a computer is still necessary for initially converting models into a VR format, and that the experiences that it can deliver are different than the VR that’s possible on a headset with significant computing power behind it. But IrisVR chief technology officer and co-founder Nate Beatty still sees the Oculus Quest as a huge leap forward technologically. Beatty said: “The Oculus Quest is an incredible accomplishment for Facebook in terms of technology—we’ve never seen tracking this precise nor user comfort taken into consideration to such an extent in a standalone VR headset.” “Seeing this sort of tech in action drove us to adapt Prospect to a more portable setting for the first time, and we couldn’t be more excited about what we’ve created.”
