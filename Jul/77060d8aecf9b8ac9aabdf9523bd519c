It will also involves the construction of a 400MW combined cycle gas-to-power generation plant at Temane. TREP will enable private investment of around US $750m for generation. According to Zayra Romo, the project’s senior energy specialist and task team leader, TREP will finance technical studies in support of regional power integration and renewable technologies in power system planning and operation, including Mozambique’s role in regional trading. “The Temane project plays a major role in increasing opportunities for power trade among SAPP countries. Despite the abundance of energy resources in the sub-region, lack of cross-border interconnections remains a major constraint. The full integration of SAPP countries’ power systems and more power trade could bring savings of US $42bn in investment and operating costs till 2040. The Bank is committed to helping southern Africa realize these potential savings”, commended Deborah Wetzel, World Bank Director for Regional Integration for Africa, the Middle East and Northern Africa.
