The government of Nigeria has flagged off the construction work of 11.5km road linking Malaminna-Kurba-Titi up to Kundulum communities. Speaking during the flag off ceremony, Gombe State Governor Inuwa Yahaya, said the road will be the first to be constructed by his administration, and the aim is to link the communities with the state capital to boost agriculture and commercial activities. “The road will support agriculture and grant access to the Dadin Kowa power plant. It will also help in security logistics, to move personnel and attend to distress calls,” said Inuwa Yahaya.
