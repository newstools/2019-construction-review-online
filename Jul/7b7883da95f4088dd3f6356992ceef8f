Completion of upgrade works on Luthuli Avenue in city centre Kenya delays. This is because the project engineers noticed that they had forgotten to improve its drainage system. Luthuli Avenue, one of the city’s most congested routes, is supposed to be converted into a one-way street to improve safety, mobility and accessibility. The upgrade decision came after a recommendation by the United Nations two years ago when Luthuli Avenue emerged the first in a list of the most populated and busiest avenues in the capital on a feasibility study carried out then.

The project which was scheduled to end two months ago include rehabilitation of the street, construction of a pedestrian walkway, painting of road markings and installation of lights as well as air pollution controlling gadgets to contain pollution of the air. The latter however, is a pilot project. According to the County’s Environment Executive Veska Kangogo. She said that they will monitor the project after completion before they evaluate its suitability and if the gadgets record a reduction of air pollution along Luthuli Avenue, then the County Government will replicate the project in all other regions of the county. The project is being implemented by City Hall alongside UN-Habitat. Chak Wang, a UN Habitat official hailed the plan to decongest Nairobi’s CBD in order to save money, time and also reduce air pollution.
