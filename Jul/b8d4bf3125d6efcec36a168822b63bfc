South Africa is set to commence construction works on the long awaited pedestrian bridge  in Somerset West. The need for the bridge arose as learners from Gordon High School and Danie Ackermann Primary School, as well as other pedestrians, cross the road during peak traffic times. Provincial Department of Transport and Public Works, Byron la Hoe announced the reports and said that personnel are already on site, waiting for a permit from the City to start work on the main water line.

The 48-m-spanned bridge will have a structural steel arch and concrete deck. The estimated duration for construction is 15 months. The Western Cape government says the bridge will be a major safety improvement for both pedestrians and motorists travelling on the N2. Some of the major risks on these routes include high traffic volumes, negligent driving and animals on the road. The N2 from Cape Town to Somerset West, inspite of only measuring 45.5km, this road ranks 13th overall due to the number of fatal crashes which are mostly the result of human error and high traffic volumes.
