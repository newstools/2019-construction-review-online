It will paveway for the Apapa seaport in Lagos to be capacious and free from the unwanted gridlock that has circumvented it which is deterring people’s movements in the arena. “We are committed to this because we are already under pressure to find a lasting solution to the embarrassing gridlock in Apapa, Lagos which has deteriorated following the perennial poor port access roads,” said Governor, Rotimi. Other areas of interest covered by the MoU include: exploring the potential to develop Oil Blocks and Strategic Storage Terminals, developing cashless solutions for internally generated revenues (IGR) on direct assessment
