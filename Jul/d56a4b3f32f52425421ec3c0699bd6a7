However, 84 months later the contractor has managed to tarmac 70% of the entire project. CDICC says that the remaining 30% has been creating inconveniences in the county denying the county residents easy road transportation. Nyoro Construction Company has for that reason been directed to fasten their work in order to complete the remaining 12 kilometer section before the newly stipulated deadline. The contractor, represented by John Mugo blamed the delay on cash-flow challenges which affected the implementation of daily activities on the site, slow relocation of power lines and water pipes along the site also disadvantaged continuous construction of the road. The company however revealed that it has increased machinery and man power to hasten the work and promised the committee that the remaining work should be finished on time. The St. Mary’s-Gitugi- Mioro road serves rich agricultural areas neighboring Aberdare forest. Once completed, cash crop growers, more especially tea farmers shall benefit hugely from the new all-weather road as cost of transportation of green leaf to the local Gatunguru tea factory shall reduce gradually. Kenya Rural Roads Authority is currently tarmacking about 14 roads within Murang’a County, a move that is expected to facilitate transport and boost economic activities in the region.
