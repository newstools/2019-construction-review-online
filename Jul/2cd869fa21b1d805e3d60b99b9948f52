The project name Almaza, meaning diamond in Arabic, is derived from the rich history of philosophies, planning and design aspirations from Heliopolis, which has been integrated into the planning and design of City Centre Almaza’s shopping experience. The City Centre Almaza  upon completion will become the primary retail and leisure destination within the dense and affluent catchment area of Heliopolis. It is projected to offer the most exceptional space design, retail mix, dining and  entertainment facilities that are tailored to the community.
