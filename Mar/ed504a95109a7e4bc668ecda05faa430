The government of Rwanda has signed an US $400m agreement with Gasmeth Energy Limited in the construction and maintenance of a gas extraction plant, processing and compression project in Lake Kivu. The firm signed the agreement to the effect with the government through Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RMB) and Rwanda Development Board (RDB). RDB Chief Executive Officer, Clare Akamanzi said the move is a positive step forward towards implementing environmental friendly fuels to reduce over dependence on charcoal and wood as the main cooking fuel in the country. “Lake Kivu contains dissolved carbon dioxide and methane gases which poses a great risk to plants and animals dependent on oxygen at the lake. However Methane gas is an energy resource which is valued at billions for Lake Kivu region”, said Clare Akamanzi.
