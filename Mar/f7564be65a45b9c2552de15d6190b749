After a first physical auction held in Zeebrugge (Belgium) in December 2018, where more than 150 units were sold, Equippo announced it will be having a new auction happening on March 28 on the same site. A wide range of construction and lifting equipment will be available to buyers on-site and online. Online shopping enthusiasts will benefit from a new user friendly interface. Thus, Equippo adds to its specialty, the online sale of used heavy equipment, an auction offer, which will allow, especially large accounts – construction and rental companies, to sell big volumes of equipment at a good price. The Equippo marketplace offers an exclusive selection of fully inspected construction machines – protected by a money back guarantee – and provides a hassle-free global delivery service.
