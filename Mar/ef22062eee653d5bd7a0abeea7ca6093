Department of Roads will get US $25m for trunk roads and bridges that were washed away and other structures while US $3m will be disbursed for operational expenditures for emergency and recovery works by the DCP. The Cyclone Idai-induced flood destruction and infrastructural damage killed 98 people and more than 200 still missing in the three provinces. the torrential rains and winds of up to 170 kph swept away roads, homes and bridges and knocked out power and communication lines. The government has declared a state of disaster in areas affected by the storm. This brought about double disaster to the country as it was also suffering from a severe drought that had wilted crops. Ncube  also lauded his much-criticised 2 percent tax on electronic transfers introduced last October, saying the US $50m was “the social impact of the tax in action”.
