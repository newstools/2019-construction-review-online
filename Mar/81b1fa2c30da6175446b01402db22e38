The participation of ISOMAT in the exhibition BAU 2019, the world’s leading exhibition of architecture, building materials and systems, was held with great success, held from 14th to 19th January 2019, at the Messe München Exhibition Center in Munich, Germany. ISOMAT’s innovative booth visited engineers, architects, contractors, installers and distributors from all over the world and had the opportunity to get to know the company’s new product solutions for the construction industry. Experienced and specialized ISOMAT engineers have shown to visitors, among others, the innovative polyurethane systems for waterproofing and covering ISOMAT PU SYSTEMS, decorative floors with stone carpet or chips, the cement screed product range and decorative floor coverings, walls and built-in furniture, advanced roofing systems and polyurethane flooring, as well as new industrial floor coatings. The participation of ISOMAT in BAU 2019 was aimed both at the opening of new markets abroad and further consolidation of the company on the German market where it operates through its subsidiary TRIANGEL Spezialbaustoffe GmbH, which it acquired at the end of 2017. It is stressed that 34% of ISOMAT Greece’s turnover comes from exports, while 47% of the consolidated turnover of the ISOMAT Group comes from sales abroad. ISOMAT will continue to be present at the largest construction exhibitions worldwide, further enhancing its commercial presence in foreign markets.
