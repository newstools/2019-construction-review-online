Training and development of our partners and our teams are of strategic importance for Sika in Africa. Empowerment of all the people that can interact with us. With SIKA ACADEMY in Africa, one of the ideas is to train professionals responsible for construction projects and partners who promote the application of Sika solutions, sharing knowledge and discussing with all interested parties about basement to roof solutions value in theoretical and practical sessions on topics such as concrete, waterproofing, refurbishment, sealing and bonding, flooring, roofing, industry. Each event is expected to receive customers, such as dealers, specialized applicators in the construction, ready-mix and precast companies, as well as architects and civil engineers, project managers or even collaborators of public and private institutions. With SIKA ACADEMY in Africa we transfer knowledge according to the competences of our teams and guests. Â We act not only with our customers, but also with universities, schools and other institutions where we believe we can add value. Since May 2018, several people have benefited of these programs in different counties: Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ethiopia, Morocco, Algeria, Mozambique, Kenya and others. In view of the growing success of these meetings, other sessions are scheduled for the following months. Ask your local Sika Company!
