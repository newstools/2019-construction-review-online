According to the energy company, negotiation of coal purchase agreements with coal producers are at an advanced stage, with a fully developed term sheet with one producer currently under review. “The fact that we are already discussing commercial power offtake and being able to progressively integrate the outcomes with the technical work of the DFS, allows us to align the power station design accurately with offtakers’ requirements,” said Louis Coetzee. Moreover, the assessment of integration of renewable technologies at the project is being conducted. Kibo is investigating the practical integration of renewable energy and associated technologies within the future Benga power station. It is considering the potential use of solar energy, combined with energy storage solutions, as an integrated solution for power back-up. “The integration of renewable technologies is an exciting add-on to the project. We are confident that this, combined with Kibo’s focus on clean-burning coal-fired power generation, will put the company at the forefront of development in this regard,” said Coetzee. Kibo which owns 65% of the project are currently advancing the development of the plant project together with Mozambique energy company, Termoeléctrica de Benga S.A.
