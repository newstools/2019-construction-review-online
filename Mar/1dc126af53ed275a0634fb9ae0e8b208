The plant will integrate proven technologies – smart intake; separation and membrane systems; advanced oxidation; biological filtration; and sludge treatment,” said Henry Charrabé. Meanwhile, the company is in discussions to arrange third-party financing for the Government of Ivory Coast through a loan from Israel Discount Bank. Financial close is expected in the third quarter of 2019 after which construction will commence. The facility will be completed within two years from the date of commencement of construction. Additionally, Fluence has also been invited to bid for an operating and maintenance contract, which could provide further recurring revenue. Subject to financial close and project commencement, Fluence expects the contract to contribute revenues of up to US $20m in 2019, US $80m in 2020 and the balance in 2021.
