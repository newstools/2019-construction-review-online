However, the contract was terminated in June 12, 2017 due to several challenges attributed to mobilization and capacity experienced by the contractor. The road which will have a 15-year-lifeline initially cost US $2.06m but increased to US 2.08m. The increase in cost was attributed to design reviews which are yet to be approved by Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) Responding to delayed compensation, the UNRA said that some Project Affect Persons (PAPS) declined offers made by the chief government valuer, prompting a longer compensation process than they had anticipated. The authority however affirmed that the payments are expected to come through in the next two months, subject to the PAPS consent. The project has faced theft challenges by suffering multiple thefts of fuel, protection gear and equipment’s on site due to a large workforce. “Those who rejected the first evaluation will be placed on the supplementary evaluation report after we conduct  reevaluation,” said UNRA Project Manager Mr Peter Kwiri.
