The project upon completion aims to increase to increase the overall refining capacity at the site by 60% to 175,000 barrels per day alongside raising the refinery’s current LNG production by about 145,000 tonnes per year, that of benzene 95% by about 600,000 tonnes per annum and lastly jet fuel by about 1.3 million tonnes yearly.
