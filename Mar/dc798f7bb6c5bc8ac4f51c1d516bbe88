Construction works delayed due to Ethiopian laws which states that consulting activities for any construction in that country should only be done by an Ethiopian company. Sileshi Consult will be responsible for the design and supervision of the construction of the Chancery and apartments. The current chancery in Addis Ababa has been in use since 1965 but was last year certified unfit for human habitation by both the Zambian and Ethiopian governments. Sikaneta also added the Zambian missions abroad will save public funds spent on rented office spaces and accommodation for diplomats. The Embassy is currently spending US $45000 monthly on rentals for office space and accommodation for Embassy staff which is a costly expense to the country. “The Embassy is spending US $45 000 on rentals per month but that reconstruction and building a block of flats will only cost US $7m,”  said Sikaneta.
