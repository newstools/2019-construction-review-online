The construction of a Parliament Complex in the Republic of Congo is geared towards its completion in 2020 as planned. Jean-Jacques Bouya, Minister in charge of planning of the territory of the Congo confirmed the reports and said aerial photos showed work had been advanced on the complex. Construction works on the US $58m project, fully funded as a donation from the Chinese government, kicked off in May 2017, in an event that was presided over by the country’s Lon-serving President Denis Sassou Nguesso. Construction of the parliament building is currently being undertaken by Chinese firm Jiangsu Provincial Construction.

The country’s parliamentary delegation have already visited the site of the project located in the capital Brazzaville. Upon completion, the new parliament will accommodate joint sittings of the senate and the national assembly. “This project is helping to open the capital city to modernity and remains one of the biggest cooperation projects carried out by China in sub-Saharan Africa in the form of a gift,” said Jean-Jacques Bouya. The project has however faced critics from human rights activists and the opposition who  believe that a new parliament is not a priority for a country fraught with rights issues and political violence in the Pool region “The priority for us is the resolution of the crisis that has shaken the Pool for a year and the improvement of the human rights situation as a whole,” said Trésor Nzila, executive director of the Congolese Human Rights Observatory in Congo.
