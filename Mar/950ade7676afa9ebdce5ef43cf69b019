Tanzania is set to begin construction of Dodoma stadium which was proposed about 3 years ago during Moroccan King visit to the Nation at an estimated cost of US $100m. The Stadium will be strategically situated at Nanenane area along Dodoma- Morogoro highway to make it visible to all passersby using proposed ring roads that will be running around the stadium and those using the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) network which is close to the structure.

Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa, from outside. According to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Tanzania National Roads Agency (Tanroads), Patrick Mfugale the proposed mega stadium upon completion will have the capacity to accommodate between 85, 000 to 100, 000 spectators. This number exceeds the 94,736 spectators that the First National Bank (FNB) Stadium, currently the largest stadium in Africa, can accommodate, and for this reason Dodoma Stadium is anticipated to take over FNB’s crown. The FNB Stadium, AKA Soccer City or The Calabash, is located in Nasrec, bordering the Soweto area of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The Calabash name is as a result of the stadiums design which was inspired by a Calabash or other African artefacts made from the hard shell of a fruit in the gourd family “Lagenaria siceraria” by drying and hallowing it out. The delivery of the new stadium will put Tanzania in a better position to bid for hosting major continental events such as the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), African Canadian Soccer & Cultural Association (ACSCA), as well as other top athletics events such as All African Games and World Athletics championships.
