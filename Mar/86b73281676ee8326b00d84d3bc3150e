The government of Mozambique has launched an international public tender for a consultant to help it develop a US $4.2bn Mphanda Nkuwa Hydroelectric Project on the Zambesi river. Augusto de Sousa, the Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, announced the reports and said that the ministry is looking  for a company to help prepare the legal and financial structuring of the Mphanda Nkuwa dam, as well as the associated transmission system. “The selection of consultants will be made through a competitive international contracting process, with competing companies having proven experience in carrying out similar work with the same complexity,” said Augusto.

The project was approved in 2007 but plans stalled due controversial issues on relocation of families that will be affected by the project and its effect on the Zambesi’s downstream irrigation systems. It was however revived by the President Filipe Nyusi in August last year. The selected company would work with the Mphanda Nkuwa Hydroelectric Project Implementation Office, created last February to oversee the scheme. The dam will be 103m tall and is expected to have a power capacity of 1.5GW. This according to the deputy minister will increase the country’s installed capacity from 1GW to 8GW over the next 25 years, and enable universal access to mains electricity. The ministry is also currently looking to hire a director for this agency.
