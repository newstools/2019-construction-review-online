It will be constructed by a Chinese firm, STECOL. The Minister pointed out that the road will greatly benefit agriculture and tourism sectors in Eastern and Northern Provinces and in return increase trade between the two provinces and the country. “This road connects two of the largest agricultural producers, the northern part is the largest producer of potatoes, among others, while the eastern side massively produces crops such as maize and banana. It had been difficult for both provinces to trade among themselves but now with the road, it will be made easier,” said Mr Uwihanganye. The road will be installed with public lights all the way, allowing business to operate 24 hours. It will additionally reduce traffic experienced in Kigali and the distance used to reach to different areas. Other roads construction that under the President’s predge include; Ngoma-Bugesera-Nyanza road which have been slated to begin in July while Base-Rukomo road is already in progress, scheduled for completion this year.
