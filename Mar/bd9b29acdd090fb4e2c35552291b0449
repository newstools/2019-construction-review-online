Construction of US $6.9m Ngong Market in Kajiado County is set to begin after a deal was reached to move more than 2000 traders from the proposed site. The project which is financed by World Bank through the Nairobi Metropolitan Services Improvement Programme (NAMSIP), incurred delays due to a long standoff between the county government. It had been threatened by disputes on relocation procedures which had not been agreed between the two parties.

The government has however acquired a 3acre temporary  site for the traders. It is is located next to Ngong Stadium and each trader will occupy one and half meter space. The site was opened by Infrastructure CS James Macharia and Kajiado Governor Joseph ole Lenku. As part of the relocation deal, traders at the temporary market site will enjoy a three-month exemption from paying daily access fees. The temporary site will pave way for demolitions of the old market. “We have asked all the traders to leave the streets and road reserves and move to the new site. We want work on the new market to start next week and once complete it will give Ngong traders a chance to feed the satellite towns in Kajiado and Nairobi,” said Mr Macharia. The new proposed market will accommodate over 3000 traders once complete after the projected seven months construction deadline.
