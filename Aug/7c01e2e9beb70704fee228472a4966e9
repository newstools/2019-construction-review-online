The government of Zimbabwe has allocated 21 contracts for the reconstruction of road infrastructure damaged by Cyclone Idai in Chimanimani and Chipinge. The cyclone was a vicious sweeping in Zimbabwe at high speed destroying anything in its way, uprooting trees and destroying bridges and roads. This resulted in most parts of Chimanimani being cut off and the area becoming in inaccessible by road at a time when the majority required help and food assistance. The Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Joel Biggie Matiza toured construction sites across Chimanimani to get an appreciation of progress made and to impress upon the Government’s desire to see works completed before the onset of rains.
