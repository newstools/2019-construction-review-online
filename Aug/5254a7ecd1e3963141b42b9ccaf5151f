Construction works on a US $5m, 350-bed mother and child facility (MCH) at the Kapsabet County Referral Hospital (KCRH) in Kenya has kicked off. This is in a bid to improve providence of convenient and quality healthcare following a shortage of space which forced patients to go to an extent of sharing beds and other facilities. According to Governor Stephen Sang, construction of this kind of facility is a great milestone and he is positive that it will help the National government to realize its agenda of universal affordable healthcare. He also expressed his gratitude to the national government for the support it rendered in ensuring that the hospital is well equipped with vital machines that will assist in providing quality healthcare. Governor Sang mentioned that currently the county has a renal unit, two theaters of which one is situated in KCRH while the other one operates in Nandi hills district hospital; a CT scan diagnostic equipment, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and an oxygen plant. He urged residents to make use of the health care equipment at KCRH in order to minimize the trips made to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), in search of treatment, which will consequently narrow down the cost of medication by reducing transport expenses.
