The government of Ghana is set to construct a multi-purpose stadium at Tema Manhean near Accra. A Zambian company, Wembley Sports Construction Company limited (WSCCL) is contracted to construct the sports and recreational complex. The Member of Parliament Nii Adjei Kraku II cut the sod for the construction of the 1000 capacity multi-purpose stadium which was initiated by the Tema Traditional Council. According to the Deputy Minister for Transport, Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus-Glover, the project will be a collaborative effort between the Tema Traditional Council and the Government.

The first route will pass through VALCO to the slaughter house, while the second one will course through Lube Oil Company back to New Town. The government will fund these projects through the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA),” he added. In addition to that, Daniel Nii Kwartei Titus-Glover said that engaging the youth in the project will help equip them with the needed skills which will be essential to them for prospective job opportunities in the area of construction. The ultra-modern field, whose construction is being championed by the MP, will not only have an AstroTurf as its fieldwork, it will also have a multi-purpose court for basketball, lawn tennis, a playing ground for children and a car park. The facility is expected to be completed by the end of December. The government will also embark on a project to upgrade the Tema Manhean clinic into a 100-bed capacity Hospital. WSCCL’s flagship project “One Constituency, One Artificial Football Tur” has so far constructed over 10 fields at Walewale, Kyebi, Marina, Nungua, Ablekuma Central, Airport West and Adenta among others.
