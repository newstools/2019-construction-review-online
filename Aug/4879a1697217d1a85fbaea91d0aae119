Other communities set to commission solar hybrid mini-grid in the coming weeks include Kare, Dadin-Kowa and Tsulaye communities in Kebbi State, and Akpabom community in Akwa Ibom State. “The move to light up every nook and cranny of Nigeria reiterates the commitment of the Buhari-led administration in fulfilling its mandate to ensure electricity access for Nigerians. Families and businesses in Upake will have access to clean, sustainable and reliable electricity from the sun. This enhances productivity and provides jobs in the area,” said the CEO. The REA is tasked with providing equitable access to electricity across Nigeria to maximise the economic, social and environmental benefits of rural electrification grants, to promote off-grid electrification, and to stimulate innovative approaches to rural electrification. REF projects are administered using a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model.
