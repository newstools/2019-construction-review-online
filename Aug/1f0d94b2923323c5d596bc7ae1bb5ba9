Installation of pedestrian footbridges along Thika Highway is set to be completed in the next two months according to The Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) Director-General Peter Mundinia. KeNHA says two footbridges to be installed on Thika Highway will arrive this month as they had opted to have the bridges welded in China, therefore, delaying the scheduled completion date of June 2019. “The other two footbridges will arrive in the next two months, and once they are in the country, the installation will be done immediately,” said Mundinia. The footbridges which are aimed at reducing pedestrian accidents on the busy highway will be installed at Garden Estate Junction, Survey of Kenya, Mang’u area and Witeithie. “Footbridges for Mang’u area and Witeithie will arrive later this month while the rest will arrive in about two months and we will install them immediately,” he added. Construction works to install the four footbridges started in March 2019, bringing the total footbridges along the route to 18. KeNHA selected Interways Works Limited and Fourways Construction Limited to spearhead the project.
