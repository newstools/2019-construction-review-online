Newly constructed Kasubi and Busega city markets, both of which are located in Kampala’s Rubaga Division in Uganda, are expected to start operations in September and December this year respectively. This was announced by government authorities who believe that the facilities will upturn production and marketing of agricultural commodities, improve income for vendors, increase employment and customer satisfaction. The vendors thanked the government and also expressed their anticipation for these markets saying that they will improve their working conditions by providing permanent working stations. Located in Kasubi City along the Kampala-Hoima road, Kasubi Market project is executed by Sterling Civil Engineering Ltd and funded by Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) at a cost of US $ 406,470. The KCCA spokesperson, Mr. Peter Kaujju, said the institution is committed to creating more working space for the city’s poor population to improve their livelihoods. “Just last month, we initiated the construction of Kitintale Market in Nakawa Division and we are set to roll more projects across the city,” he said. Kasubi city market will accommodate 1,200.
