Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, the construction company handling rehabilitation work on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, is set to resume works on the project. The Ogun Sector Commandant of Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) Mr Clement Oladele, confirmed the reports and said that there will be partial closure of a section of the expressway for rehabilitation. Mr. Oladele said the rehabilitation work would cover Berger end of the road to Ogun River Bridge at the popular Kara Cattle Market totaling 1.4 kilometres. ”The rehabilitation work will initially affect 600 metres of the corridor and cause the temporary closure of the inward Lagos traffic to enable the construction company carry out the rehabilitation work on the road,” he explained. “The temporary diversion of traffic will transfer the Lagos inbound traffic to the same carriageway conveying traffic outward Lagos, thereby accommodating both the traffic inward and outward Lagos on the same section of the expressway,” Oladele added.
