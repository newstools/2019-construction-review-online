The project will also help to provide access to modern bio-energy fuel. The minister further commented that, once completed, the project will deepen the bilateral relationship between the two countries. “The project will create opportunity for German Small Medium Enterprises to take advantage and extend their products and services in the area of waste to Ghana. Therefore, the project’s success will not only help Ghana to address her energy and sanitation challenges but also encourage replication of the project nationwide,” he concluded.
