Nigeria has commissioned the country’s first 2.8MW solar hybrid power plant at Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu Alike Ikwo in Ebonyi State. The project which was commissioned by Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is expected to provide clean-generated power for 1,819 staff members and 7,700 students at the university. The project falls under the Energising Education Programme (EEP) of the Federal Government of Nigeria which was implemented by the Rural Electrification Agency (REA). According to the REA Managing Director and CEO, Damilola Ogunbiyi, the programme will surely boost the quality of education, research, and health care services in Federal Universities and Teaching Hospitals in the country. “I really commend the women for the role they have played in the successful implementation of this power project. From the head of the project who is a woman to the female STEM students that worked on the project,” he added.

On the impact of the FUNAI solar hybrid installations thus far, the EPC Contractor and CEO of Sterling & Wilson, Deepak Thakur, said that the installed 2.8MW solar hybrid power plant will decommission petrol and diesel generators with a capacity of 1.54MW, creating a cleaner and environmentally friendly atmosphere for the university community.
