The government of Ghana has signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia to construct Medical University to be situated in northern Ghana. The agreement which was signed between Ghana Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia and King of Saudi Arabia, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud comes after the Vice President secured an agreement with the Government of Cuba for the training of 40 qualified students, drawn from the Zongos and other deprived communities, as medical doctors in Cuba.

This programme would come as a welcome opportunity for such students to realize their God-given talents. And Insha Allah, this partnership between the Governments of Ghana and Cuba will produce more doctors from Zongo and other deprived communities in the country,” said Dr. Mahamudu. “Establishing a Medical School will significantly reduce the scarcity of doctors and other medical personnel in the northern part of the country. This giant step to advance the health needs of Ghana, together with Government’s other initiatives on education, vocational skills, sanitation and infrastructure development in the Zongo communities, which are being driven through the Zongo Development Fund, clearly underscore Government’s vision for the Zongo community,” he added. The agreement will also see construction of additional 42 senior High Schools throughout Ghana to increase access to education for the youth, especially girls. The Vice President said the government’s commitment to providing more opportunities to disadvantaged communities in Ghana, including the Zongo community, was not in doubt.
