Geo Products manufactures the EnviroGrid product in Houston Texas with all raw materials also produced in USA. Their EnviroGrid material was invented by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The company’s first customer was the United States Army that purchased, in 1990, 6.4 million square feet for “Operation Desert Storm”. The US Military used products to create tank trails, haul roads and landing strips over soft sand with their EnviroGrid filled with the same sand. For the past 27 years EnviroGrid has been used worldwide for not only soil stabilization but also for slope and channel erosion protection and retaining walls. The EnviroGrid® cellular confinement (geocell) is manufactured from high density polyethylene (HDPE).

In addition to EnviroGrid® Geocell, HPDE is used to manufacture geomembrane liner for subtitle D sanitary landfills, pit liners, mining leachate ponds as well as pipe and other industrial products. These are just a few examples of the hundreds of uses for high density polyethylene.
