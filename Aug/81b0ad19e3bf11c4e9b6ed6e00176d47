The immediate past governor of the state, Dr. Babangida Aliyu, started the project in 2013 but could complete before the expiration of his tenure. “We have been on this project for more than two years now, but because of the paucity of funds, we could not continue with the initial proposed stadium”, said Mr. Alhaji. According to Alhaji Baba Sheshi, Director of Sports, Niger Ministry of Sports Development, the 15,000 capacity stadium has space for future expansion. The development contract was awarded to a Chinese firm, Sun Way Steel Building Company, based in Abuja. The stadium will be constructed with more steel concentration and reinforced with concrete for best durability. It will be developed in three phases. The first phase will be the main bowl, the second phase will be for indoors and the third phase will be for hotels, which will be constructed by interested investors.
