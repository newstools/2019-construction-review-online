Some of the exhibits displayed at the museum include Jaramogi’s fly-whisk and old pictures dating back to post-Independence. There is also a briefcase, clothes and ceremonial hats that symbolize the power and traditional authority the first vice president of Kenya had in his days; the famous akala shoes, a goatskin and a bed belonging to Jaramogi. The facility has been worn out after standing for two decades without a fresh coat of paint or major repairs. President Uhuru Kenyatta had directed that the building be refurbished when he visited Jaramogi’s home at the end of last year.
