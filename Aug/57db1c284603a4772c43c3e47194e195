This after the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport led by their MEC Mr. Jacob Mamabolo cut the sod to mark the resumption of the rehabilitation and upgrading works. “Road infrastructure is the key to any country’s economic progress. If we are serious about the township economy, investments such as this are a necessity,” said the MEC while addressing the Mamelodi community members. The road project will be fully funded by the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport at a tune of US $4.19m. The 12km road project involves dualing of the existing carriageway to increase its capacity, improve safety and accessibility for existing and future developments along the K69.
