Atlas Roofing started with Structural Insulated Panel (SIP) Roofing Systems in 2006. The first application was for an office block in Pretoria – over steel purlins with suspended ceilings. Since then, the company has undertaken and successfully completed many SIP roofing installations – each project different and unique. Atlas Roofing started off with a small specialized team of workers but it has grown steadily to a company with four to five trained and well experienced teams working on various sites at a time, along with offices and a manufacturing facility plus a warehouse based in Capital Park, Pretoria. SIPS are high performance building systems made for residential and light commercial construction.The panels consist of an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural facings. The board can be a metal sheet, plywood, cement, magnesium oxide board (MgO) or oriented strand board (OSB) and the core can be expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), polyisocyanurate foam, polyurethane foam, or composite honeycomb(HSC). Other than been cost effective, SIPs are energy efficient, they lower electricity bills, they maintain acceptable temperatures, they reduce carbon footprint, they have high R-Value rating and low U-value rating (heat loss), they are easy and fast to install hence save you time and labor, and they can be used in conjunction with Photo Voltaic panels. Atlas Roofing SIPs are made up of Magnesium oxide ceiling board (9mm), Polyurethane foam Insulation (80mm), Mineral Torchon or Bitumen roof shingles oriented strand board (11mm)  Atlas Roofing Roof panel are tested and passed by SANS1077-10.
