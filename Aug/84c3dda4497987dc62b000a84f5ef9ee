The government, of Liberia has officially dedicated the newly constructed market in the Old Road Joe Bar community to dignify the selling areas of marketers. The official turning over ceremony was performed by the country’s President George Weah who commended the works done and said that the government will do its best to fix the economy, but called on citizens to maintain the peace, as there cannot be development in the mist of conflict and confusion. “What was damaged during the 14 years of civil war. This government is focused on rehabilitating Liberians whose lives were damaged as a result of the civil war. I don’t want you to join those who are undermining the country through protests. Join me to rebuild the country,” said His excellency.

The project took 31 days to be completed as planned. The old market, which was constructed several years ago, was in a deplorable state leading to the new development. Facilities at the ‘new’ Old Road Joe Bar Market in District #10, Montserrado County, include 400 tables, 13 shops, six modern latrines, including provisional stores to enable marketers store their goods in a much more secured facility. Duport Road Community is one of few communities that have already benefited from market buildings, which the President has promised to construct. The 14-Gobachop is another market being built which is is expected to contain distinct compartments for the sale of different food stuffs and other goods as well as car park.
