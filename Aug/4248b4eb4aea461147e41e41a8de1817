The county government of Kisumu in Kenya has put in place plans to revitalise the lakeside city through a programme dubbed ‘Revitalising Kisumu’s Waterfront’. This is in line with the campaign to bring back the glory once held by Kisumu port, as a vibrant marine transport system that connected East African countries, and positioning the host city strategically in the marine economy of Kenya. Even though the plan is still at its threshold, the local government believes that the project will give the city a new look as well as increase its potential to attract tourists.

It also entails setting up an 18-hole golf course, a cultural center, a 10,000-capacity convention center and a four-star hotel as well as refurbishment of three major streets in the central business district. The three major streets are Kenyatta Avenue, Oginga Odinga and Ang’awa streets. The construction will begin at Kisumu Boys High School roundabout to the KCB roundabout, then to Obote Road and Ang’awa Street, which links Oginga Odinga Street and Jomo Kenyatta Avenue. Upon completion, no vehicles will be allowed through the streets, exclusively meant for pedestrians. The plan also includes building modern entries and beach fronts at Dunga Beach and Hippo Point, this is according to Kisumu County Lands and Urban Planning Chief Officer Steve Gome. “We had planned to build the entries and beach fronts where Lwang’ni was, but unfortunately the area has been occupied by the port. We therefore allocated Dunga Beach and Hippo Point land for the same,” he said. The project is expected to bring in handy attractive opportunities in residential, hospitality, leisure and retail sectors that will spur the region’s growth.
