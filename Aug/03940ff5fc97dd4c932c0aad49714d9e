South Africa’s Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has confirmed that construction works on the US $828m Mokolo-Crocodile Water Augmentation Project Phase 2A will not commence due to an appeal launched back in April by Earthlife Africa and groundwork, against the environmental impact assessment (EIA) authorization issued in December 2018 by the Department of Environmental Affairs. Earthlife Africa and groundwork called on the Minister to review and set aside the authorization of the project, owing to environmental impacts the project will bring including the impact it will have on the climate. In June this year, the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) announced it had started the implementation of the project which is designed to transfer water to support energy and mining activities in Limpopo province including Eskom’s Medupi coal-fired power station. However, according to DWS spokesperson Sputnik Ratau, a project cannot continue when there’s an appeal against an EIA authorization. “This, however, does not prohibit any organization against continuing its preparatory works in anticipation of the project.The project is currently at the preparation stage with documentation and tender-design having commenced,” he added.
