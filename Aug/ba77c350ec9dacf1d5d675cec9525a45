The government of Ghana is set to begin construction of a new bridge over the Volta River on the Eastern Corridor road, next year. This is after the government approved a loan agreement of US $112.39m from the Japanese government for the project in December 2016. The bridge, which will be Ghana’s second longest, will be an asphalted dual carriageway with ancillary facilities including pedestrian walkways, bicycle lanes, a mini rest stop and toll bridges. The project seeks to complement the government’s effort to develop the Eastern Corridor road which is the shortest route connecting the Greater Accra, Volta, Northern and Upper East regions.
