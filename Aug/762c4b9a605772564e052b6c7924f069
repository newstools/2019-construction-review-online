Ethiopia is set to receive a US $98m grant from the African Development Bank (AfDB) for the construction of the Ethiopia-Djibouti corridor road project. The entire project is expected to cost US $255m. The government of Djibouti is expected to contribute US $5.3m to the project through an AfDB grant, leaving a deficit of US $151m which will be covered by the Ethiopian government through a co-financing contribution. The project consists of the construction of the first 60-kilometre of a 4-lane expressway section of the new 126-kilometre stretch from Adama to Awash and includes the design of a one-stop border post at Dewele.
