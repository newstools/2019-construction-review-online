The frequent cuts in power supply have been having a toll on businesses and domestic consumers. According to the African Development Bank (AfDB), the energy poverty in Africa is estimated to cost the continent 2-4 % GDP annually. It is estimated that in the Sahel region – Senegal, Nigeria, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Eritrea, about 64% of the population lives without electricity, hindering economic and social development.
