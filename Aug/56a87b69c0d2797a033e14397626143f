The government has structured the remaining 29 berths to be handed over to private sector investors for financing, construction and operation. Once complete, Lamu port is expected to create job opportunities not only in port operations but also in agriculture, fishery, manufacturing, logistics, transport, trade and commerce. In addition, the port is predicted to appeal to large cargo ships and provide benefits in the region by passing on savings as a result of lower marine costs due to faster ship turnaround time, reducing the cost of doing business.
