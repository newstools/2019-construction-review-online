This versatile range of AHUs from TROX Technik uses high impact-resistant rigid PVC for casing frames, thus totally eliminating any chance of thermal bridging occurring. The PVC extrusions are treated with enhanced heat stability UV agents which enhances durability of the units against sun exposure. A further major advantage of the PVC frames is that they are completely corrosion resistant, which makes these AHUs ideal for use in areas of high moisture and salt content. 31 standard sizes in vertical or horizontal configuration. Suitable for airflows from 0.5m3/s to 25.7m3/s Contact us for more information,
