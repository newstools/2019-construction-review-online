Construction of the New International Airport in the northern Bengo municipality of the Luanda province, begun in 2007 in an area of 43 hectares and the first phase was delivered in 2012. However, in 2017 the construction works came to a standstill following the termination of the contract with then contractor China International Fund (CIF). According to the Transport Minister for the republic of Angola Ricardo Viegas D’Abreu, currently there are negotiations with a new construction contractor, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China group. “The negotiations will be concluded within 15 to 30 days after which an appendix to the contract will be signed,” he added. He also admitted that there had been some defects in the previous contract signed with CIF and as a result, during the work stoppage a few corrections and changes to engineering and operational deficiencies were made, particularly to the terminal and the runways. “Moreover, we have US $1.4bn funding from China, meant for the project,” he affirmed.
