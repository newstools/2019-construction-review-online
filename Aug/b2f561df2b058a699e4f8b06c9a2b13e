Egypt is set to develop its first-ever vertical forest project in its New Administrative Capital. Misr Italia Properties has signed a cooperation agreement with Stefano Boeri Architetti, to establish the Vertical Forest Project on a 10,000 acres land. According to Stefano Boeri Architetti’s Deputy Chairman Mohammed Khaled al-Assal the company will offer up the first stage of the project for sale in December 2019. “The development will consist of one hotel building and two residential buildings containing 300 units,” he said. Stefano Boeri Architetti’s owner Stefano Boeri further added that a company that runs a chain of hotels in the world will manage the three buildings, and that the buildings’ balconies and windows will carry thousands of trees and plants aiming to reduce pollution. “The main focus is to reduce pollution and relieve the pressures of population density,” he affirmed . Construction of the development which is part of the IL Bosco project in the New Administrative Capital, is set to start in June 2020.
