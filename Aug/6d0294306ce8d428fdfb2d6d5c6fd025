The Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) has announced that the first phase of the Takoradi-Tema Interconnection Project (TTIP), to reverse the flow of natural gas from the Western Region to Tema, has been completed. According to the authority, completion of the first phase has paved way for the smooth flow of gas from the Aboadze power enclave for use by the various gas offtakers in the Tema-Accra power and industrial enclave.

GNPC provided finances and necessary comforts to the partners to ensure the successful completion of the project. The National Gas Aggregator also provided end-to-end advice in the design and scoping, as well as monitoring of the project execution. The Tema section of the TTIP, which includes revamping the WAPCo Tema Regulatory and Metering Station (RMS), is ongoing and expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2019. Commissioning and performance testing of the scope of the project had been successfully carried out. “Ghana Gas’ ability to supply gas for a stable production of electricity means that, cost of electricity to the final consumer will now be relatively lower as compared to the use of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) or diesel as fuel for electricity generation,” said CEO of GNPC Dr Kofi K. Sarpong. This project is projected to double the capacity of Ghana Gas to transport GNPC’s gas to feed critical national power generation facilities sited in the Western enclave.
