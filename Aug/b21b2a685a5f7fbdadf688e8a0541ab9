The government of Egypt through the National Authority for Tunnels has signed an agreement with a consortium of Orascom Construction and Arab Contractors led by Bombardier, a Canadian manufacturing group, to design and build the countryâ€™s two automated monorail systems in a contract valued at US$ 4.5bn. According to the contract, the Canadian manufacturing group will be responsible for the design, manufacture, supply, and installation of electrical and mechanical equipment for the two lines, including 70 four-car Innovia Monorail 300 trains, to a total of 280 cars. Nevertheless, the company will also handle, among other things, automatic train signaling and control technology including fitting an operations control center with communication systems.

Upon completion of the project, the consortium will be responsible for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of both lines for 30 years. The first monorail line, with 21 stations, will extend 54km from Nasr city, East of Cairo to the New Administrative Capital which is currently under construction in the desert while the second line with 12 stations will be 42 km long connecting 6th October City to Giza. Upon completion, the system running on a single rail will dramatically improve the quality of life for more than 20 million people residing in the Egyptian capital by transporting about 45,000 passengers per-hour in either direction and significantly reducing their daily commuting time. It is projected that with operating speeds of up to 80 km/h, the journey time from east Cairo to the New Administrative Capital will be around 60 minutes while that of 6th October City to Giza will be approximately 42 minutes.
