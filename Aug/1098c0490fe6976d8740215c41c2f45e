Renovation works on Cape Coast Sports Stadium in Ghana have begun. Minister for Youth and Sports, Hon. Isaac Kwame Asiamah confirmed this after his inspection visit at the site. The Cape Coast Stadium is Ghana’s first sports project of this scale since the country hosted its last Cup of Nations in 2008. It was constructed in 2012 at a cost of US $33.35m. The Chinese government contributed roughly US $30m, while the Ghanaian counterparts submitted US $3.35m; after which the facility was officially handed over to the government in 2016. The stadium complex has a 22-room hostel facility, a canteen, kitchen, fire-fighting room, storage rooms among others. It also features a 300 car parking capacity, two basketball fields, a handball court and tennis court, and an indoor facility that can be used for any indoor games. The complex which was designed by the China IPPR International Engineering Corporation led by architect Zhou Ju, is set to receive the face-lift following a three-year maintenance MOU signed between China and Ghana in September 2018 when President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo visited the country.
