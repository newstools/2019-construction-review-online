The government of Seychelles has commissioned a real estate project that will provide 700 transit houses with solar energy for people affected by disasters. Philip Morin, Public Utilities Corporation (PUC) Executive Director said that development aims at mitigating impacts of electricity bills. “We have installed a 3KW unit on the roofs of three-bedroom ho mes; two-bedroom homes will have a 2KW unit while one-bedroom homes will have 1 kW. This will reduce the impact of electricity bills on families and improve their lives,” said Mr. Morin.

In addition, the company will install a 1MW unit on Romainville Island for use in eligible homes under the project. On islands affected by bad weather, transit houses are very important,” he added. During a state visit to New Delhi last year, President Faure signed agreements for a line of credit of US $100m from India. Over 30 projects were submitted to be implemented under the small development projects. These also include renovation of schools, the building of fences and the purchase of mobile libraries. Solar energy is an efficient source of energy that the government of this Seychelles is working to promote. The authorities depend heavily on small solar power plants and home-based solar kits such as those installed in transit houses due to the scattered nature of the island.
