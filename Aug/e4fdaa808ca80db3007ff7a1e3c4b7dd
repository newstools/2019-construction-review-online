Over 26% of Kenyans live in cities and the urban population is growing at a rate of 4.2 % every year. This level of growth creates tremendous pressure on the housing market. For example, Nairobi requires at least 132,000 new housing units annually to keep pace with its expanding population. Yet only 50,000 homes are built, creating a growing housing deficit of 82,000 units per year. This situation has contributed to the development of large informal markets. It is said that, 61% of urban households in Kenya live in undignified settlements of which 70-80% in rental units. To address this issue, the government of Kenya has made affordable housing a presidential priority and is committed to facilitate the construction of the houses between 2017 and 2022. Cabinet Secretary also held a talk with Qatari Prime minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani and Jassim bin Saif Al Sulaiti, Transport and Communication Minister, Qatar to improve the cooperation between the two countries. He emphasized the fact that Kenya will continue to work with China together with neighboring countries to have a seamless experience in the construction and securing resources to have the most positive impact in the lives of Kenyan people.
