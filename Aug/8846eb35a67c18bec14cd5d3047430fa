The Delta State government in Nigeria has announced the successful installation of a new Instrument Landing System at the Asaba International Airport, as part of its effort to upgrade the airport. According to a statement by the state’s Commissioner for information, Charles Aniagwu, the installation of the new ILS means that bad weather reports will no longer affect the operations at airport, including aircraft flying in and out of the airport. “Once the ongoing installation of the Air Field Lighting systems is complete, the airport will be able to operate at night without any problems; conforming to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) standards,” he added.

He further called on the relevant regulatory authorities to give the required approvals for the operation of Boeing 777 and other bigger airplanes in and out of the airport. Asaba Airport serves Asaba, the capital of Delta State of Nigeria. It also serves Onitsha, across the Niger River in Anambra State. The airport was initially opened with great expectations in 2013, but rapid deterioration of the new runway has required major restoration.
