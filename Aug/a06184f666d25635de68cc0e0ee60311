The government of Botswana has awarded 100km pipeline project to Khato Civils. The company will be working together with Water Utilities Corporation to implement similar projects that will contribute towards social and economic emancipation of communities in the identified villages along the corridor of the new 100km project. According to Khato Civils CEO, Mongezi Mnyani, due to the urgency of water supply required into greater Gaborone, the design and implementation of the project will be fast tracked and completed within 12 months of the award of contract. “The site establishment processes are already underway including the mobilisation and sourcing of all required materials for the execution of the project,” he added.
