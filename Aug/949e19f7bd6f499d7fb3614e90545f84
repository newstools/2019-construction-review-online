Nigeria is set to commence construction of a new shopping mall in Kaduna state worth US $10.7m. This is after Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the development. The mall dubbed ‘Amsalco Galaxy Mall’ is being constructed at the Murtala Muhammed Square in the heart of Kaduna city, through a public-private partnership between the Kaduna State Government, Amsalco, a private firm and the United Bank for Africa. The project is part of the state Urban Renewal programme targeted at providing modern infrastructure in the state capital to boost economic development. “The dream of a Galaxy Mall was once aborted, but we have revived it with a new investment structure and partners. Let everyone, therefore, do their duty so that it can become a viable and living reality,” said Governor Nasir.
