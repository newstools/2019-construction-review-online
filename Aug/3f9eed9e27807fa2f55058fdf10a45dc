South Africa Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel has launched a US $9.5m high-voltage power cables plant in Port Elizabeth which is set to contribute significantly to the South African economy and create jobs for youths. Mr. Patel noted that the Chinese power and fiber optic cable manufacturer Hengtong has more ambitions to strengthen its operations in South Africa with an investment of about US $70.6m, including the construction of a new fiber-optic plant. “This investment was made possible by the government’s commitment to encouraging local agencies to buy designated power cables locally. To date, we have only had one company producing high voltage cables locally and by the opening of this new plant we are encouraging healthy competition in the market, this provides the industrial capacity for the African continental free trade area,” said the Minister. “As a Ministry, we aim to open up new markets for local products and increase levels of investment in our country in order to address economic inclusion,” he added.
