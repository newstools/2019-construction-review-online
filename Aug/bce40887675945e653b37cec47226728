This will allow residents to embrace the remarkable heritage and captivating rhythm of the Mother City, as well as form part of the dynamic identity of one of Cape Town’s oldest villages. The revamping works involve partial demolition of the existing building to strengthen its structure and enable the insertion of a modern four-storey residential component. Showcasing a modern aesthetic, the new masonry building will feature punctured openings, steel balustrades and timber shutters with the penthouse level clad in Rheinzink. It is designed in a way each apartment will have clean, contemporary lines with floor-to-ceiling windows and timber flooring while the parking, office and retail spaces will be refurbished to a high standard with the size of the office floor plate increased and the retail and restaurant areas reinvigorated. The central courtyard, which sits at the heart of the development, will be activated through the creation of a new green oasis with flanking and cascading planted terraces. An attractive timber brise-soleil will hold the edge of the courtyard on the northern side while providing a visual barrier between public and private realms. The redevelopment is slated for completion in 2020
