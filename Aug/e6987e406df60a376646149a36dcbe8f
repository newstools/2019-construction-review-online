The Nairobi Gate Industrial park, located in the upcoming Northlands City of Ruiru, off the US $387m dual Eastern Bypass, is set for completion early next year. Speaking during the project’s timeline update, Improvon Group CEO Stefano Contardo said that some companies have already established themselves in the Kenyan market and they are potential tenants for the development. Improvon is a South Africa based industrial property developer focused on the warehousing and logistics property sector within sub-Saharan Africa, and that has teamed up with private-equity investor Actis to build the state-of-the-art industrial business park together as ImpAct. Louis Deppe, a partner for real estate at Actis, said that he is confident that Nairobi Gate will be a success and that a similar design will possibly be replicated in other African countries.

It will also integrate corporate offices in line with modern trends plus excellent access, wide roads and turning circles that can accommodate interlink trucks in addition to generous loading facilities and the highest standard of security, all set in a park-like environment. Moreover the park will offer the most recent practices in green design and sustainability that optimize natural light and harness temperature regulation and water reticulation, making it cost effective and less impactful on the environment over the long term. Nairobi Gate Industrial park is most suitable for light industry, warehousing and distribution centers, considering its makeup and its proximity to main transport and logistics hubs in the country e.g. the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and the Inland Container Depot.
