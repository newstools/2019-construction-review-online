This plant is a turnkey solution project meant to generate electricity for the Medical Center that will cover its consumption, enabling it to better serve its patients by establishing a reliable source of clean energy that covers the center’s consumption of electricity and, as a result, access to a secure energy source that is a critical component to the Hospital’s ability to deliver sustainable and reliable health care. The system consists of 25,090 Philadelphia Solar Polycrystalline panels of 325 Wp each and Philadelphia Solar Mounting Structure solutions. The capacity of the system is 8.2 MWp, which is considered to be the largest PV system installed for a single medical center in the world.
