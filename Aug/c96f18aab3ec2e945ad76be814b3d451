The electricity produced will be channelled to the national grid managed by state-owned Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM) to cover the shortfall that some districts in the province currently face, namely Lago, Mecula, Mecanhelas, Mavago and Mandimba. Once completed, the plant will increase the quality of electrical energy and promote the industrialization of Niassa province, an objective included in its strategic plan for the next twelve years.The project is also expected to employ 200 people and boost local businesses in the areas of accommodation, catering, rental and sale of essential goods The plant will be located where it will stimulate development of industry in Niassa through the transportation of raw materials and final products from their production sites. The power plant will also help address deficiencies in electricity supply in the northern half of the country, as well as promoting the development in Lichinga.
