The Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Health and the County Government of Nyeri is set to construct a US $290,766 level four hospital in Kieni Constituency. The health facility will be constructed on a 10-acre piece of land and will help ease congestion at Nyeri County Hospital which serves the greater part of the constituency. Patients have to travel over 50KM to access health care in public hospitals. In addition to the project, the county of Nyeri has already started construction of US $3.2m hospitals in Naro Moru, Kieni East Sub-County. This will be the first big hospital of its kind in the region since independence considering the region only has dispensaries and health centers currently.

In a few months, we will be breaking ground for construction of the facility which will bring reprieve to residents,” explained the legislator. The hospital will also be used to train students studying at the KMTC campus once operational. Nyeri Governor Mutahi Kahiga on his side pledged to allocate sufficient funds to the project in order to improve healthcare in the county and spearhead President Uhuru’s big four agenda on the provision of healthcare for all. “The residents of Kieni Constituency are the only ones without a level four hospital but my government promises to allocate more funds towards the construction of the hospital at Kiawara as we proceed with construction of the other level four facility at Naro Moru,” he said.
