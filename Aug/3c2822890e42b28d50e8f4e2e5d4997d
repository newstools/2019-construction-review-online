With the construction of the harbour city of Tema and its numerous industries, this project will enter the manuals of the Tema-Ashiaman enclave as one of its most unique innovations that would take comparative advantage of other industries in the cosmopolitan area. It will be one vital project under the One District, One Factory flagship programme engaged by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, since it is expected to provide over 2,000 direct jobs to Ghanians when complete. When executed, the project will change the landscape of the entrance into Ashiaman Township and also create a positive image for the municipality widely assumed for its notorious criminal activities and other negative vices. The project will greatly improve security along the motorway, because its location will dislodge criminals who hide along that stretch to attack and rob innocent citizens, even in broad daylight.
