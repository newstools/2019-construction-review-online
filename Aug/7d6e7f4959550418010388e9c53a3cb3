The government of Ghana has begun connection of transmission lines to Karadeniz Powership Osman Khan (Karpowership) that will enable the supply of power to the national grid. The Powership will be off the national grid for a maximum period of 17 days – enabling it to carry out various pre-commissioning works to successfully connect with the 330kV transmission lines in Sekondi. The relocation is in line with government’s strategic policy for the Powership to utilise Natural Gas from the Western Enclave. This will save government millions of dollars annually.

The powership, which contributes 450MW of power to the national grid, is currently off after disconnecting from the grid in order to set sail to Sekondi. Immediately after the re-connection to the grid at its current location, the powership will continue to run on heavy fuel oil (HFO) until in the middle of November 2019, when it will be connected to off-take the natural gas from the country’s oil fields. When connected, the generating units will be supplied with the 90 million standard cubic feet of gas daily (MMSCFD), which will reduce the cost of transporting gas to Tema and make gas cheaper compared to HFO. The relocation will also help avert further the take-or-pay contracts that the country is paying without using lean natural gas (LNG) from offshore fields.
