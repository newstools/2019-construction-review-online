The government of Ghana has secured US $76m to resume construction of Bolgatanga-Bawku-Pulmakom road in the Upper East Region. A Brazilian Contractor, Queiroz Galvão, has resumed work on the 116km Bolgatanga-Bawku-Pulmakom road after the project stalled for several months due to lack of funds. The project was awarded under former president John Mahama to Queiroz Galvão and a local contractor MAWUMS in 2016 at a cost of US $76m with funding from the Road Fund. The road will be an international highway that links the Northern sector of Ghana to its neighbouring ECOWAS countries where only 40km of the road has so far been completed.

He further assured the country that the project which began in the latter part of 2016 and was expected to be completed within two-and-half years, will be completed before the end of next year. The road will pass through six districts: Bolgatanga, Binduri, Pusiga, Garu, Bawku West and Bawku municipality and link the Upper East Region to Burkina Faso and Togo. Queiro Galvao will work on the bigger portion of the road, stretching from the end of the Sakote township through Bawku to Pulmakom, as well as some Bolgatanga town roads to the Zuarungu area to form the entire Bolgatanga-Bawku-Pulmakom road. Once completed, the project will ease the pressure at the Paga border where cargo trucks heading towards Burkina-Faso, Mali and Niger converge and spend days working on their documentations. The project will also add lots of economic benefits to the country.
