We look forward to working with NRECA International to execute the study, and to leverage its extensive experience in electricity cooperative business models to pave the way for the implementation of transformational projects across Africa,” said Batchi Baldeh. “We selected Nigeria and Ethiopia following dialogue with their respective ministers of energy during the Bank’s Africa Energy Market Place held in July 2018, where they expressed their governments’ commitment to improve rural access through established models. We rely on this cooperation to explore this innovative model of delivering our High 5 to light up and power Africa,” explained Baldeh. Baldeh added that the cooperatives rely on strong partnerships among governments, rural, local communities and development partners for implementation and success. Findings of the study will be delivered in May this year. upon which the bank will inform the viability of plans to pilot the model in the selected countries.
