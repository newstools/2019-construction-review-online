The construction of the project is divided into four phases and put out separate tenders to design it. The three remaining sections are Makutupora-Tabora (294km), Tabora-Isaka (133km) and Isaka-Mwanza (248km). The country plans to spend US $14.2bn over the next five years to build the 2,561 kilometre-SGR connecting its main port of Dar es Salaam to land-locked neighbors including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. In July, 2016, China, through its Exim Bank, agreed to advance Tanzania US $7.9m for the railway project, despite its key contracting firms having been omitted from the project. The project will contribute positively to Tanzania’s future development to meet an increasing demand for the transportation of passengers and improve the domestic supply network.
