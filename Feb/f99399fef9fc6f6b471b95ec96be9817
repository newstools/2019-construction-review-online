The government of Zimbabwe has revealed plans to build a multi-million dollar state-of-the-art stadium in the south western part of the city. Harare City Council Housing Director,  Addmore Nhekairo confirmed the reports and said the stadium, which is expected to cater for some of the high-profile games will be constructed at whopping cost of US $1.4m. “This facility will be known as Highglen Stadium. The reason is to decentralize the city’s sporting infrastructure because you find that in that part of the city there is no recognised sporting infrastructure,” said Addmore Nhekairo.

Construction works of the multi-million dollar state-of-the-art stadium is expected to take four years. It will go a long way in decentralizing sporting infrastructure because in that part of the city there is no recognized sporting infrastructure. “You will also realize that there is a big shopping mall in that area, but it lacks patronage because there is no activity, so, this stadium will help make the area lively,” said  Nhekairo. “Currently, we have five stadia that we have as a city, but looking at the demands that the city requires, we have decided as a city to come up with a new state-of-the-art stadium which will be located to the south of Highglen, close to the round-about,” he added.
