This agreement comes shortly after the signing of an MOU between the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa50, and the African Development Bank to develop and fund a road-rail bridge linking Kinshasa and Brazzaville. The President pointed out that the project will be one of his priorities as part of his vision to build regional networks to foster trade and economic development. At a later stage Africa50 may invest in the project along with partners, including other development finance institutions and private sector lenders.
