The government of Uganda through Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has issued  alternative routes to motorists planning to use Binaisa and Namirembe roads to pave way for construction works. Mr Jacob Byamukama, the KCCA’s acting director who confirmed the reports said that the US $ 272,553 road project will run for three months, and will be done in phases to avoid traffic gridlock. The project is being funded by the Government through the Uganda Road Fund (URF).

Additionally reconstruction of walkways on both lanes of the dual carriage way, installation of kerbs, and construction of a cut off drain on the northern lane of the dual carriage way will be done. Upon completion, the road is expected to reduce traffic jam at Kubbiri and Mulago roundabouts. Motorists can turn left into Mawanda Road, into upper Mulago Hill Road to Mulago Hill and then onto Tufnell Drive where they can join Kiira Road. They could also either use the routes above or move into Church Road down to Gayaza road where they can then join Bombo Road and further still, traffic police officers will be placed at the Mulago, Dwaliro and Kubbiri roundabouts to help in directing traffic flow. While Binaisa Road will majorly be motorised upon completion, Namirembe Road will be non-motorised, with only pedestrians and cyclists allowed. The Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) project will cover both Namirembe Road and Luwum Street with a major aim of reducing congestion.
