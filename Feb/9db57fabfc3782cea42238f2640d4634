Surgeon medications, antibiotics and paracetamol are among other drugs that will be produced by the factories. According to statistics by the minister for Health, Tanzania imports about 94% of its needs in medicines from Kenya, Uganda, India and other countries – with only 6% being sourced locally. “The country is very much in need of these industries because currently the government depend heavily on Foreign Regulatory Board (FRA) which in return, out of every cent  that the government spends on medicine procurement, 90% goes to foreign countries,” said Ms Ummy Mwalimu. Ms Mwalimu also urged government institutions such as the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC) and Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to collaborate with investors to remove barriers that might affect them in the construction of pharmaceutical industries.
