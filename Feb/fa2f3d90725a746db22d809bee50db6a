Ms. Freda added that the ministry aims at moving away from traditional building methods and incorporate new technologies. The building material would use environmentally friendly construction techniques that would make the home building more attainable. More than 3,000 jobs will be created during the construction process with the energy efficient rooftops used being manufactured locally. The 100,000 homes would benefit the local community while alleviating the 1.7 million housing deficit in Ghana. Upon completion of the development, the project value would scale up to US $5b.  Ghanaians would acquire the affordable housing units through mortgage financing. The ministry of works and housing have confirmed talks with banks and financial institutions to provide beneficiaries mortgage facilitation. The UNOPS Social Impact Investment Initiative (S3I) is under the mandate of the UN General Assembly. Similar projects are being executed in Kenya and other parts of the world.
