Bodies stay in homes when people die. We can’t continue like this,” said Dr Mushimba. “This is also something again we campaigned on to try and empower communities, our youths with skills and places to spend time away from beer halls. This will be a nice home away from home to recreate, gain skills and a sanctuary away from beer drinking in butondo,” explained Dr Mushimba. The third project, according to the MP would be the drilling of boreholes in Kankoyo central. He said the water that they drink in Kankoyo central was industrial water. “We want to stop the challenge of having someone walk long distances in search of water by digging boreholes where people will access natural clean water for their domestic use. As the council begins their tendering processes, I encourage kankoyo contractors and youths to be ready and fully participate in these works,” he added.
