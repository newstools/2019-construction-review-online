Mr. Maitre added that the main contractor has also managed to adhere to agreements made with local communities, a prerequisite of which was to employ adequately skilled people from the local workforce. ADA Consulting was contracted at the inception of the project in September 2017 to do the civil works. Eventually, the company became involved in all aspects of the upgrade, which included designing the conveyor gantries servicing the storage silos used for soya beans and sunflower seeds storage. It will also be involved in the installation of the plant and boiler next month. The boilers, which are used to provide steam for the processing plant as needed, will boast a surplus of steam, which could be sold to the neighboring plant that has an older, multi-fuel boiler system.
