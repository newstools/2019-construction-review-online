Work on Kanyemba floating bridge that will link Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique through Kanyemba border post is expected to start before the second quarter of this year, following finalizing processes for the introduction of the ferry boats on the Zambezi river by the Zambian authorities. Zambian Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Development, Cde Joel Biggie Matiza, confirmed the reports and said that the multi-million dollar project will establish a floating bridge that will be used as a deck to ferry heavy trucks across the Zambezi into Zambia and Mozambique.

It is also part of a corridor-long infrastructure improvement program that enhances regional trade and integration,” said Biggie Matiza. The project will create the shortest route linking up Zimbabwe, Zambia and Mozambique, reducing the link distance by a massive 550 kilometres and thus cutting costs on fuel and time. The Project funded by the Japan government, will boost trade among the three countries while it revives operations on the border post which had retreated into a ghost point due to inactivity, with a broad forecast of further linking with the rest of Central Africa. Supportive infrastructure such as the road network to the area is being worked on with revelations that 5 kilometres of the approach road to the pontoon landing bay is complete with a drivable surface. The project was granted national project status with at least US $24m allocated toward the capital projects in the area bordering Zambia and Mozambique. Developments of the Kanyemba and the Kazungula are part of Zimbabwe’s 2030 vision of transforming the country into a middle income economy. It is scheduled for completion in 2020.
