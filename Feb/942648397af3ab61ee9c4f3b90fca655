 According to him, this is the only way to achieve the One Household one toilet initiative currently in the region. He made this appeal when he was inspecting ongoing projects in the area including public sanitation facilities with washrooms in all communities. Each of them contains between 12 to 16 water closets.

The project has four components. The first component is provision of environmental sanitation and water supply services to priority low income areas of the GAMA. Construction of the facilities which are under the management of the various area councils, is ongoing at Numesi, Djagbletey, Manya, Asutsuare swap and Asutuare Local Council, Ayikuma, Apperkon, Dorjumu, Natriku, Agormeda, and Fiakonya. The DCE stated that the GAMA project provided 11 Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies (MMDAs) in the region with households and institutions with toilets leaving out the only four districts in the region. “It was for this reason that I am appealing to the implementers of the programme to roll out the four remaining districts to enable the beneficiaries to improve on sanitation in their communities,” he said. In a similar development project, Mr Akuffo who was in the company of officials of the assembly also went through the renovated Dodowa District Court. The Dodowa library renovation project, classroom blocks under construction at Tokpo, Osuwem and Volivo are also among the projects inspected. The team also inspected the electrification project being undertaken at Wokpe, a suburb of Osuwem and Community Health Planning System (CHPS) compounds at Larnon, Osuwem, Ayikuma and Asutsuare junction.
