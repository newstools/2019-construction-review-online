Now he is back on site on full construction works, the survey works, geotechnical investigations have all been completed. So, the actual construction work has now started,” said Mr Adebiyi. Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) was going to work on the section between Okokomaiko to Agbara. Mr Adebiyi affirmed that procurement processes had already begun towards award of the contract. “This project is part of a major project from Lagos to Abidjan and that the ministry was doing its best to speed up construction on the Lagos side,’’ added the Federal Controller of Works in Lagos, Mr Adedamola Kuti. The project which is due to be complete in 36 months, will help expand the real estate of the axis and the tourism potential of the Badagry axis. The economic benefit of the project will be really great since it will lead to a lot of tertiary institutions along the corridor of this project.
