KeNHA had earlier compensated some residents who are set to be relocated to pave way for the construction of the road where else KPA is still compiling the final list of those to be compensated during the construction of the port. “The first phase of the compensation for the affected residents started in December last year. The project is scheduled to commence soon. Right now the compensation is ongoing and we expect that also to be completed as soon as possible,” said Robert Ikegi. The project will consider locals for the more than 1,000 direct and at least 2,000 indirectly jobs which are expected to be created as soon as the project begins. Along with resettlement, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was also brought on the table for discussion with the residents expressing their concern on the deterioration of the environment through depletion of resources that the projects are likely to bring with.
