IDC was established in 1940 by an Act of Parliament (Industrial Development Corporation Act, No. 22 of 1940) with the aim of spearheading the development of domestic industrial capacity, especially in view of the shortage of manufactured goods experienced as a result of the disruption of trade between Europe and South Africa during the Second war.
