F-2 bituminous Isolation membranes are fibro glass wire-reinforced, fiberglass-reinforced, APP (Atactic Polypropylene) additive, both sides polyethylene film coated and obtained by saturating carrier with bitumen asphalt. F-2 Fibro glass water Isolation membrane is used generally in roofs, pergola and Isolation points requiring water Isolation. Isolation membrane is used in TOKİ, KİPTAŞ, project basic screen Isolation and bundling Isolation, sloping roofs of parking area and terraces of projects, tile and ceramic substrate Isolation. Balcony, flower terrace, garden terrace Isolation. Concrete flumes, rain gutters and hidden creeks. Some projects basement retaining walls, sewage treatment plants and pressure groundwater projects. Water tank Isolation. Ponds, swimming and ornamental pools. Isolation membrane is flexible and durable. It can easily be applied to different types of surfaces in membrane applications for TOKİ and KİPTAŞ projects. Isolation membrane has a high tensile and tear strength. Isolation membrane is resistant to adverse conditions that may occur in the soil. Water Isolation membrane can be easily applied in the details such as dilation, edges of chimney and return of the parapet. Surface where Isolation membrane application will be made should be cleaned from loose soil, oil and other chemicals. Surface defects are repaired with Starfix repair mortar. For a healthy application it is advised to use İzopak water Isolation membrane primer bitumen emulsion as a primer to the surface.

Bituminous Isolation membrane Isolation is applied by 10 cm or 15 cm ride side by side from joints. In roll finishing points 15 cm space is made and bituminous water Isolation membrane is adhered to entire surface with oxyacetylene torch fully by heating. Isolation water membrane rolls should not be stored upright. Membrane rolls should be protected from direct sunlight. After Isolation application finished no piercing and cutting process can be performed. In walked terraces where Isolation membrane is applied it should be protected with floor coatings. Bitumen waterproofing membrane is a waterproofing membrane produced with polyester felt or glass fiber carriers by modifying the bitumen (asphalt) in different penetrations with polymer based materials. These covers are used in almost all areas related to waterproofing in buildings. Soil can be used in floors, floors, roofs, ponds, highways, bridges, viaducts etc. This material, which is usually produced in 10 – 15 meter rolls, should be used by qualified craftsmen with high quality workmanship and should be kept at room temperature and in dry conditions. İzopak Liquid Membrane Super Elastic Rubber Fiber Reinforced 18 Kg Bucket (New) Izopak Liquid Membranes , which are ready for use, are used for rubber and fiber content moisture and water insulation; are among the top preferences of the companies valuable customers like their other products due to their economic quality and high quality.
